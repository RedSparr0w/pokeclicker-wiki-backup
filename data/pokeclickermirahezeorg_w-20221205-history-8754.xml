These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

'''Page Creation''' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
'''Finishing Touches''' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
'''Updating''' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
'''Formatting''' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# Create all uncreated [[Template:Underground Items|Underground Items]]
=== Finishing Touches ===
=== Updating ===
# Add all Loot to the Wiki, add explanation of Loot Weight to main [[Dungeons|Dungeon]] page, add Loot to Aquisition tables on all item pages (command line on Discord) - '''Note from JK: Do not do this yet, feature is being actively rebalanced'''
# Update all the [[Shops]] and [[Items]] ([https://github.com/pokeclicker/pokeclicker/pull/1730/files PR 1730])

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# Make a "Wiki Code Hunt" for the game codes. Trivia questions should be added in a way to encourage wiki engagement. Once the hunt is made an NPC can be added to the game referencing it.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# add Shiny Variants to the normal Pokémon and a way to swap between the images.  This is something that's up to debate, as there's little use for it other than being something for us to do.

== Completed tasks awaiting moderators ==
