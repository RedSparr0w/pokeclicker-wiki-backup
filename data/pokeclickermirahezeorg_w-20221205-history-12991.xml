    <text bytes="795" space="preserve">Hello, I am LatiosRider. 

I am also LatiosRider on Discord. I'm not on Discord all of the time, but I'll notice when I'm mentioned pretty quickly. Unless I'm asleep or otherwise preoccupied of course.

I actually only joined the Pokéclicker Discord right after the original loot update occurred. Once I noticed that the loot was different I wondered which dungeons were the best to grind. Since the subreddit was mostly quiet, I decided to finally join the Discord. Joining also meant I could discuss upcoming changes for the game which meant that updates would not seem as random as before.

After joining the Discord, I was able to find the Github for the site. I have a background in coding, so I don't really have much of any issue wrapping my head around how the code for this game works.</text>
