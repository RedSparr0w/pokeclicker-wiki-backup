[[Wacan]] berries will speed up the growth rates of [[Rindo]], [[Passho]], and [[Occa]] berries planted adjacent to them. This timing table does not account for this deviation in growth timings. However, it is a relatively minor difference that does not significantly impact ripenings of all four berries at about the same time. Furthermore, the other three berries (Rindo, Passho, Occa) have long enough wither times to allow for this minor discrepancy to be unimportant. Finally, the most likely limiting factor in achieving the Haban mutation is the Wacan berries withering, and these can be replanted several more times prior to any other berry types withering.</text>
