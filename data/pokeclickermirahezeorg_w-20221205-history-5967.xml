    <text bytes="534" space="preserve">Note: The minimum harvest amount for any berry is 1.  If the harvest amount is less than 1, you will still get at least 1.  However, having a harvest amount of less than 1 affects how many berries you get from [[Farm_Items|Rich Mulch]] and Passho berries.  For example, with Rich Mulch and surrounded by 8 Passho berries, a Maranga will yield 16 berries, but a Liechi will only yield 8 berries.  For some helpful farming configurations to harvest more berries or grow berries faster, consult the [[Farming Setups|Farming Setups page]]</text>
