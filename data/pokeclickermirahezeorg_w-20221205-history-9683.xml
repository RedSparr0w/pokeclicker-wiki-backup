    <text bytes="491" space="preserve">The Fast Ball decreases the amount of time needed to catch a Pokémon after defeating it, allowing a player to catch Pokémon and obtain Dungeon Tokens at a faster rate.

The Fast Ball is obtainable through trades with the Berry Master of Goldenrod City in Johto. These trades are reset daily and differ between accounts. The Fast Ball may not be offered every day, nor is it guaranteed that you will already have all the berries in your Berrydex.
