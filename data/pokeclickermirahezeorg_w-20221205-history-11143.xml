    <text bytes="11876" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# '''PART''' Wandering Pokémon added to main berry page, consider adding uniquely attracted Pokémon to each berry infobox

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# '''PART''' [[Shard Case]] page created, needs to be formatted in the same way and use the same templates as the other [[Key Items]]. See [[Wailmer Pail]] for Reference
# Add an Infobox to [[Shards]] displaying an image of the in game Shard Case
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# '''PART''' [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l74KcfoY3Qs97RLJLwnpJYWcy2RzQ79e?usp=sharing|Berry Flow Charts] created for most berries. Need Kasib, Colbur, Apicot, Lansat, Starf, and Enigma ideas + diagrams
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# Upload all pokemon images non-shiny and shiny version.

    <text bytes="11536" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# '''PART''' Wandering Pokémon added to main berry page, consider adding uniquely attracted Pokémon to each berry infobox

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# Create [[Shard Case]] page.
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.
