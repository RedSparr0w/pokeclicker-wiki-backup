    <text space="preserve" bytes="2948">'''Flutes''' are a series of special items each with their own beneficial effect.
Flutes are gained by purchasing them from the Hoenn and Unova Gem Master shops.

==Usage==
Activating a flute happens when the Player clicks on the flute to activate it.  Flutes can be enabled / disabled whenever the player wants.  Each Flute buffs different properties in game, and requires 3 types of Gems to power their effects.  Activating multiple Flutes simultaneously increases the cost in gems of keeping all Flutes active.  Each active Flute costs one Gem per second, per active Flute, from three gem categories.  Thus, activating 3 flutes costs 3 gems per second of that Flutes' 3 required gem types - 9 total gems per second - per Flute, or in other words will drain 27 total gems per second.
