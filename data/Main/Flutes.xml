'''Flutes''' are a series of special items each with their own beneficial effect.
Flutes are gained by purchasing them from the Hoenn and Unova [[Gem Master]] shops.  Flutes cannot be used until after defeating [[Towns_&amp;_Cities#Hoenn|Hoenn's Lavaridge Town Gym]] and obtaining the [[Gyms#Gyms_3|Heat Badge]].

==Usage== &lt;!--T:2--&gt;
Activating a flute happens when the Player clicks on the flute to activate it.  Flutes can be enabled / disabled whenever the player wants.  Each Flute buffs different properties in game, and requires 3 types of Gems to power their effects.  

&lt;!--T:3--&gt;
Activating multiple Flutes simultaneously increases the cost in gems of keeping all Flutes active.  Each active Flute costs one Gem per second, per active Flute, from the Flutes three gem categories. Keeping all 6 Flutes active costs 6 gems per second from every type of Gem.

&lt;!--T:4--&gt;
Each active flute also provides a static +0.5% attack boost to the required gem types. If all 6 Flutes are active, then all types are given a +0.5% attack boost.

===Active Cost per Flute=== &lt;!--T:5--&gt;
