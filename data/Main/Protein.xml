    <text space="preserve" bytes="914">[[Protein]] is a consumable item that you can purchase from shops of each region's League. It can be fed to a pokemon to increase the amount of damage it gain on each successful egg hatching when you breed it. Your pokemon gain 1 damage for every Protein fed to it. Each pokemon can consume 10 Protien at a time with addition 10 more for each new region you unlock.


=== How to Use ===
Open hatchery and hover mouse on the pokemon that you want to use the protein on.
Once used the effect stays permanently and does not get removed by any means.

=== New Efficiency ===
Below is a list of pokemon that are most efficient in breeding after they have been fed maxed proteins based on the region unlocked.
