    <text space="preserve" bytes="2475">'''Farm hands''' are people that can be hired to work on your [[farm]], which are used to automate planting and harvesting berries.  Many are unlocked by unlocking a certain number of berries, while others can be unlocked from certain shops.  Once hired, farm hands will work until they are fired.  This feature is currently in beta, and is subject to change.

== Usage ==
Farm hands have 4 important stats: cost, work speed, efficiency, and max energy (see below).  At this time, farm hands recover exactly 1 energy when fired, and do not recover any more energy when fired.

! Stat !! Usage
|-
| Cost || Refers to their hourly wage, and is deducted from your [[Farmingpoints|farm points]] every hour.
|-
| Work Speed || Refers to how often they work.  &lt;br&gt; If the farm hand has energy, they will work, and lose 1 energy.  &lt;br&gt; If they do not have energy, they will do nothing and regain 1 energy. &lt;br&gt; If there is nothing to do, they will do nothing and regain 1 energy.
|-
| Efficiency || Refers to how many actions a farm hand can take every time they work &lt;br&gt; Harvesting a berry, and planting a berry count as two separate actions
|-
| Max Energy || Refers to how much energy they start with, and how much energy they can store
