'''PokéClicker''' is a clicker game originally made by '''Isha Dijcks (IshaD)''', based around the Kanto region. Around June 2017, IshaD, along with Aegyo, BaineGames, Qubit and dennism1997 started working on a complete rewrite of the project, with new regions and contents. Around 2018, RedSparr0w joined the dev team. On September 4th 2020, IshaD announced his permanent departure from the project, said his reasons was community pressure and busy schoolwork. On the same day, RedSparr0w became the lead developer of the project. &lt;br&gt;
