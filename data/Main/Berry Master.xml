    <text space="preserve" bytes="5495">The '''Berry Master''' is an [[NPCs|NPC]] in Pokéclicker. They act as both a hint-giver for certain [[Berries]] in Kanto, as well as selling [[Farm]]-related [[Farm Items|items]] and offering trades in other regions.

The Kanto Berry Master will give you a hint for mutating a berry you do not have, refreshing every day at midnight local time or when you mutate the berry for the current hint, whichever comes first. The Berry Master is required to get the 4 hints for the [[Enigma|Enigma Berry]] after you link your [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] to the game. You might get repeated hints, so this process may take a while, but the berries will be the same for separate files linked to the same discord account.

In the same way that the price of items in the Department stores and regular Pokémarts go up with increased purchase amounts, Farm items purchased from Berry Masters also increase in Farm Point cost with increased purchase amounts.  The process of decreasing the price is slightly different though - to decrease the price of the Berry Masters items, you need to gain XP by harvesting Berries.  Different Berries harvested will give different amounts of XP, decreasing the price at various rates.  Higher XP gain will decrease the prices of the Berry Master's wares faster.  To decrease the price at the maximum speed, see the chart on the [[Sprayduck#Berries_harvest_Experience|Sprayduck Page]].

Note: The berries can only be bought if in a "No [[Oak Item]]" [[Challenge Mode|challenge]].  These berries are impossible to obtain while in that mode, since they all require a particular Oak Item to be equipped to unlock.
