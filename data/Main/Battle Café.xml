The '''Battle Café''' is a place found in various locations around Galar where you can spin with your Milcery after giving it sweets to evolve it into all the 63 Alcremie forms. 

==Location==

You can find the Battle Café in the following Places:

{|class="wikitable sortable"
! Location
|-
|[[Shops#Galar: Locations &amp; Items|Motostoke]]
|-
|[[Shops#Galar: Locations &amp; Items|Hammerlocke]]
|-
|[[Shops#Galar: Locations &amp; Items|Wyndon]]
|-
|}

==Usage==

To spin your Milcery you need to select one of the seven available sweets. Each sweet costs a different amount of berries you need to pay. Once you have to select a sweet you set a spinning time from 1 to 20 seconds and choose a spin direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. 

The hour of the day when you spin (local time) can change the result of the spinning, being '''day''' from 6 am to 6 pm '''night''' from 6pm to 6 am and '''dusk''' from 7pm to 8pm

You can only make 3 spins each day resetted daily at midnight local time.
