As you earn achievements, you gain up to 100% (per region) (and 50% for Sevii Islands) more [[Poké Dollar|Money]], [[Dungeon Tokens]] and Experience from all sources. Your [[Pokémon Statistics#Click Attack|Click Attack]] is also boosted by the achievement percentage. The '''Achievement Tracker''' is unlocked after catching 110 unique Pokémon. There is an additional 150% Achievement Bonus obtainable from non-regional Achievements. Thus, the maximum Achievement bonus at any time is always as follows: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Maximum Achievement Bonus} = \text{100%} \times \text{Region Number} + \text{50% (for Sevii)} + \text{150%} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
