Questlines are special kinds of Quests where the player follows a series of steps to unlock progress in the current [[Region]], unlock certain mechanics or receive different rewards like Items and Pokémon. Some are activated at certain points of the game while others require the player to check a [[Questlines#Bulletin Board Quests|Bulletin Board]]. For the list of randomly generated Quests, please check the corresponding [[Quests]] page instead.

&lt;!--T:2--&gt;
=Main Quests=
These quests are activated automatically at certain points of the game. They usually unlock progress to certain areas of the game or give access to certain mechanics like the [[Underground]].
