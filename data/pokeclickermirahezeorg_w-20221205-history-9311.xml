    <text bytes="3681" space="preserve">'''Roaming Pokémon''' are rare Pokémon that can be found randomly while on routes.
Each [[Regions|Region]] has a set of Roaming Pokémon that can be caught.
So far, only Mew and Manaphy have no requirements to appear.

=Odds=

''For a breakdown of roaming chances on every route, visit the [[Route Statistics]] page.''

The chance to encounter a roaming Pokémon is 1/8192 for the first route of a region, and increases linearly up to 1/4096 for the last route of a region."First" and "last" here refer to the health of the Pokémon on these routes, not necessarily the order they are unlocked. This means that a route you can 1-shot will always be at least as efficient as a route you can't, so it is recommended to idle on the highest route number you can 1-shot if you need them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The way that a Roaming Pokémon is encountered works like so. First, the game calculates if a Roaming Pokémon is encountered (using the above odds description with the current route). Next, the game calculates which Roaming Pokémon is encountered from the Roaming Pokémon pool for that region. Uncaught Roaming Pokémon have twice the chance of being encountered. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An [[NPCs|NPC]] in each region can inform the player of a specific route in that region where the odds of encountering Roaming Pokémon are tripled. The boosted route changes every 8 hours. &lt;b&gt; If every route in the region can be one-shot, the Boosted Route is always the best route for encountering Roaming Pokémon.&lt;/b&gt;
