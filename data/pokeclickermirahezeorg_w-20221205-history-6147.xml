    <text bytes="484" space="preserve">====Persim Planting Formation====
Another common strategy includes mutating [[Persim]] berries if you haven't unlocked Occa, Kebia, or Colbur yet. You can find the formation and timings on the [[Persim]] page. This is a very active strategy, but this setup should provide a little over 3.58 mutations per minute on average including time waiting for growth. This strategy is also the fastest, but needs at least about 4 and a half hours of active growth and mutation time to complete.</text>
