    <text bytes="1228" space="preserve">Evolution items are special items that can be bought from [[Shops]] along with some of them being available in the [[Underground]] randomly. They can be used to Evolve certain pokemon and these evolutions can only be obtained by using the correct stone on correct pokemon. 

== How to Use ==
In the Start Menu go to Items page and select the stone you wish to use. When you select the item it will show a list of all the pokemon that you have on which the item can be used. A pokeball symbol on the pokemon means that you already have the evolution of it. You can still use the evolution item on a pokemon of which you already have the evolved pokemon of to have a small chance of obtaining a shiny version of the evolved pokemon.
