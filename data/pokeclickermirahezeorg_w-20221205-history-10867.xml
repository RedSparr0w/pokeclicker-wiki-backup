==Usage==
Each Oak Item buff different properties in game, and can be upgraded with constant use. Players start out with one slot that can be used to activate an Oak Item. As players catch more Pokémon, more slots are unlocked. 
They are as follows:
{|class="wikitable sortable"
! Slot ! Pokémon&lt;br&gt;Required
|-
| 1 | 20
|-
| 2 | 50
|-
| 3 | 100
|}

==Acquisition==
Oak Items are gained by playing through the game and capturing unique Pokémon, with the exception of the [[Squirtbottle]], [[Sprinklotad]], [[Explosive Charge]], and [[Treasure Scanner]], which can be bought from select cities.
