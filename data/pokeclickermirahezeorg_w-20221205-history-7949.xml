==Description==
The '''Battle Frontier''' is a location in [[Hoenn]] where your Pokémon fight endless teams of three randomly generated Pokémon. There is a 30 second time limit for each stage - if you do not defeat the three Pokémon within the time limit you will be awarded [[Pokémon Dollars]] {{pdollar}} and [[Battle Points]] {{Battlepoints}}. [[Items]] such as [[XAttack]] are permitted; however, you cannot Click to damage Pokémon in the Battle Frontier.

== Details ==
Attack is calculated as 100% of the total attack of all obtained Pokémon - the Regional Attack debuff is ignored. Attack can be further increased through modifiers such as [[Shards]] and XAttack. Battle Points and Pokémon Dollars are awarded upon defeat; the former can be used at the [[Battle Frontier#Battle Frontier Shop|Battle Frontier Shop]]. The higher the stage cleared, the more Battle Points are awarded. Frontier stages that have already been cleared in previous attempts will be cleared twice as fast in subsequent attempts - Pokémon Attack speed is doubled on cleared stages. 

===Breeding Strategy===

As described above, Pokémon Attack speed is doubled on cleared stages in the Battle Frontier. Additionally, the amount of egg steps gained by a single Pokémon in the Battle Frontier is as follows: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Egg Steps} = (\text{Stage Number})^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The combination of these two features in particular can lead to extremely efficient breeding in the Battle Frontier that rivals (and often surpasses) many other high efficiency breeding locations currently in the game.

==Rewards==
===Currencies===

'''Note''': Currency Rewards are not awarded if your Battle Frontier run is Quit. You must lose your attempt normally to gain [[Pokémon Dollars]] {{pdollar}} and [[Battle Points]] {{Battlepoints}}.

''Note: Enemy Health is calculated using the following formula rounded down:''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{Enemy Health} = \text{Floor}[\left ( \frac{100}{12} \times (\text{Battle Frontier Stage} + 10)^{2.2}\right )^{1.15} \times (1 - 0.05)]&lt;/math&gt;
