    <text bytes="5722" space="preserve">'''Pokéballs''' are items used to catch and store Pokémon.

=Usage=

The Pokéball selector allows players to select the type of ball they want to use to catch uncaught Pokémon, uncaught [[Shiny Chance|shiny]] Pokémon, already-caught Pokémon, and already-caught shinies. Alternatively, the trainer may decide not to catch Pokémon in these categories.

When a Pokémon falling under one of these categories is defeated, the selected ball will be used to attempt to catch the Pokémon (as long as the player has one or more of that ball). After running out of the selected type of ball, a lower-tier ball will be used instead, if there are any.

=Varieties=

As of version 0.7.5, there are nine distinct types of Pokéball, each with their own bonuses and acquisition methods. Note that the latter five balls can only be obtained by trading Berries with the Johto Berry Master. The types of Berries demanded in exchange vary from day to day.
