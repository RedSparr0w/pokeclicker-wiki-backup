    <text bytes="2984" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list! This is where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing/etc. on the Pokéclicker Wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on a page, or have an idea of new material to be put on the wiki, feel free to either add it to this page or drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We aim to have this page empty one day, but it won't be easy to do so unless everyone contributes a little.

Please do not delete tasks when completed. Write ('''DONE''') before it and move it to [[To-Do list#Completed tasks awaiting moderators|Completed tasks awaiting moderators]] so that one of the moderators can review and verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

== Categorized Tasks ==
These tasks are grouped with similar tasks for ease of navigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Page Creation''' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information. It can also be adding images to the wiki, or otherwise large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
'''Finishing Touches''' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
'''Updating''' is for pages that were affected by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
'''Formatting''' is for pages that need to have the way that information is displayed on them changed. This can range from template changes, to changes in the general aesthetic of the page.

=== Page Creation ===
# Check/Update/Add all flow-charts on [[Regions|Regional Pages]]
# Create [[Shard Traders]] Page (when update comes)
# [[Freeze Mulch]] Page (when update comes)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Add explanation of Loot Weight to main [[Dungeons|Dungeon]] page
# Update [[Item Magnet]] effects
# Update [[Shards]] Images Names and Page (when update comes)
# Update [[Quests]] Page (when update comes)
# [[Kanto]] Page (when update comes)
# [[Eggs|Egg]] Page (when update comes)
# [[Rowap]] Page and [[Pokérus]] Page (when update comes)
# [[Shops]] Page (when update comes)
# Trade Stone &gt; Linking Cord (when update comes)
# [[Baby Pokémon]] Page (when update comes)
# [[Dungeon]] and [[Route Statistics]] with Sevii (when update comes)

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so arduous (and such a low priority) that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# Make a "Wiki Code Hunt" for the game codes. Trivia questions should be added in a way to encourage wiki engagement. Once the hunt is made an NPC can be added to the game referencing it.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# add Shiny Variants to the normal Pokémon and a way to swap between the images.  This is something that's up to debate, as there's little use for it other than being something for us to do.
