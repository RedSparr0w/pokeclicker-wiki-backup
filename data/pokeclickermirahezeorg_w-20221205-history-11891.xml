We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
