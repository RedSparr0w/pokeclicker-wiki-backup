    <text space="preserve" bytes="846">*'''Example 1:''' [[Mt. Moon]] has [[XClick]] and [[Greatball]] as 2 of its 5 lootable items from Dungeon chests. The XClick is in the '''Common''' Tier while the Greatball has the '''Mythic''' Tier. This means that the XClick is much likely to drop from a chest than a Greatball.
*'''Example 2:''' [[Mt. Moon]] has [[Greatball]], [[Small Restore]] and [[Star Piece]] as 3 of its 5 lootable items from Dungeon chests. All 3 items are in the Mythic tier, but the Greatball Has Weight 2 while the Small Restore and Star Piece have the base weight of 1. This means the Greatball will be twice as likely to be dropped as the other 2 items. In other words, on average when an item looted from Mt. Moon is from the Mythic Tier, 50% of the time it will be a Greatball, 25% of the time it will be a Small Restore, 25% of the time it will be a Star Piece.</text>
