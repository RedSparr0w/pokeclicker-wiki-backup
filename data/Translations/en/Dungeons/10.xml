Two loot items, [[Small Restore]] and [[Pok√©ball]], are in Rarity Tiers of a greater rarity than ''Rare''. '''Before''' the player reaches [[Sinnoh]], the odds of finding these items increases with increasing dungeon clears, and the items will not have the Regional Debuff applied to their drop chances. '''After''' the player reaches [[Sinnoh]], only those two loot items would be impacted by the Dungeon Loot Regional Debuff in Viridian Forest. Consequently, those two loot items would become roughly 20x as rare. In general, it is better to go for rare item drops before you are affected by the debuff; however, it is more difficult to clear those early game dungeons early on.</text>
