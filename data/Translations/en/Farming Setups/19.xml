    <text space="preserve" bytes="998">For maximum efficiency you should swap from the Wacan formation to the Passho formation before the Gen-5 berries are ripe. It takes a little bit of math to perform this swap correctly due to the Wacan Growth aura variably affecting the Gen-5 berries depending on what stage the Wacan berries are in, but if you multiply the shown 'Time until Ripe' by the 'Aura Received' you get how much longer the Gen-5 berry has until it would be ripe without the Wacan Berries' effect. Since it takes some time for the Passho berries to grow, first calculate the actual time until ripe (without modifiers), and then harvest every Wacan berry when the Gen-5 berry has less time until it's ripe than it will take the Passho to ripen (including any growth multipliers ([[Sprayduck]], [[Farm Items|Boost Mulch]]) you're using on the Passho berries. Make sure to apply [[Farm_Items|Rich Mulch]] before harvesting the Gen-5 Berries! Using this strategy will yield 32 (28 cumulative) Gen-5 berries harvested per cycle.</text>
