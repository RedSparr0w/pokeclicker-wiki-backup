Combining the [[Farming Setups#Wacan|Wacan]] and [[Farming Setups#Wacan|Passho]] setups is incredibly useful when trying to quickly grow and harvest multiple Gen 5 berries that have a base 0.5 berry harvest yield, such as Starf or Petaya. This two-part setup, going from the Wacan formation to the following Passho formation, is the most efficient way to harvest more of these berries in the shortest amount of time. Using Farmhands Jessie or Riley to either: harvest and replant Wacans, or just replant Wacans as they wither (which is faster, but requires actively watching out for Kasib mutations on withered plots) is the best way to cultivate slow growing Gen 5 berries in a reasonable amount of time. Due to the very low harvest amount, completely surrounding each Berry with 8 Passho berries is the best way to maximize harvest amounts.</text>
