    <text space="preserve" bytes="885">For example, let's say I am trying to defeat Champion Wallace in Hoenn. While the Pokémon with the highest Breeding Efficiency overall is Gyarados, when accounting for the 30% damage debuff for a Kanto Pokémon in the Hoenn region it is merely the 11th most efficient Pokémon to breed. Therefore breeding Azurill, the most efficient Pokémon to breed in Hoenn, will be slightly more efficient overall to defeat Wallace. Furthermore, breeding some of the Hoenn Grass type Pokémon (e.g. Tropius, Breloom, Shroomish, Roselia, etc.) that are only slightly less efficient than Azurill is made up for by their type advantage over Wallace's primarily water type Pokémon. In conclusion, if trying to breed towards a goal focus on high breeding efficiency Pokémon that are from the region you are trying to beat with a type advantage against whatever Pokémon you are struggling to defeat.</text>
