    <text space="preserve" bytes="648">* The timings assume an equipped max level [[Sprayduck]] and the detailed amount of boost mulch on the specified plots. All boost mulch should be applied immediately on planting. In total, you need 180 boost mulch to complete the entire process; however, it is highly recommended to have at least 250 boost mulch in your inventory in case of something going wrong. Note that even though the [[Babiri]] will ripen about the same time as the [[Haban]] with only 35 boost mulch, this is a very tight window. More is added to guarantee that it completes first to avoid the chance of other berries being taken over by [[Occa]], [[Colbur]], or [[Kebia]].</text>
