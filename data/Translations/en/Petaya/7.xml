    <text space="preserve" bytes="897">You can fill your farm in the following way to obtain Petaya berries. Note that the [[Occa]], [[Kebia]] and [[Colbur]] can overtake other plants, so they are placed around a [[Babiri]] to prevent this. [[Kebia]] and [[Payapa]] increase mutation chance and are placed to affect the highest amount of mutation plots. [[Babiri]] decreases mutation chance and [[Rindo]] expands to open plots, so they are not placed near mutation plots. [[Wacan]], [[Yache]] and [[Haban]] all affect growth times and are placed in the corner with shorter growth time berries to limit their impact and make the timings easier. Using [[Farm_Items|Surprise Mulch]], a fully leveled up [[Squirtbottle]], and following this layout, you have roughly an 90.2% chance (60.5% chance without [[Squirtbottle]]) of acquiring a Petaya before the first berry needs to be replanted. Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur.</text>
