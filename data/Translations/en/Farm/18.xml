    <text space="preserve" bytes="824">* Example: [[Persim]] has a mutation rate of 2%.  This means each second the required berries ([[Oran]] and [[Pecha]]) are ripe on the farm in the proper locations to cause a mutation to occur, you have a 2% chance of mutating a Persim.  That 2% mutation is calculated per plot.  Following the above linked Walkthrough's planting formation for Persim, where there are 5 possible plots for Persim to mutate on, that means that each second the game calculates whether the 2% chance occurred 5 separate times.  The Pecha berry will only remain ripe for 1 minute, thus if both Pecha berries become ripe at the same time as Oran, each plot will calculate to see if a mutation will occur 60 times, or in other words, you have 300 chances to see if you get lucky with the 2% mutation before the Pecha withers and must be replanted.</text>
