An attacking Pokémon's damage output against a defending Pokémon is calculated as follows. The attacking Pokémon is treated as having a single type (mono-type). The type that is used is the one that does the most damage against the defending Pokémon, including any Gem modifications to the type-efficacy multiplier. In cases where the defending Pokémon is a mono-type, it will treat it as being a dual-type of said type (for example, a pure Normal Pokémon would be treated as Normal / Normal), so type effectiveness will be twice as effective (or ineffective). The sum of all valid Party Pokémon (non-[[Pokémon Day Care|breeding]]) with modifiers ([[Weather]], [[XAttack]]) is the total Pokémon Attack. Below are some examples to articulate this calculation.</text>
