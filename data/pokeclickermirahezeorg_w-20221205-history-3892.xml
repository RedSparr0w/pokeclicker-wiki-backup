==== Roseli Setup ====
You can fill your farm in the following way to have the best chance to obtain Starf berries without any additional berries. Note that the setup omits a 24th [[Roseli]], as that would allow [[Custap]] berries to mutate, and omits a 23rd Roseli as that would allow [[Lansat]] Berries to mutate if [[Spear Pillar|Dialga]] has been caught. Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur.</text>
