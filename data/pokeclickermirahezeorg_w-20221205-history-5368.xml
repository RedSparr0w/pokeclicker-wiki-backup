    <text bytes="584" space="preserve">*'''Example 1:''' [[Viridian Forest]] has four dungeon chest drops.  Two of those, [[Small Restore]] and [[Pok√©ball]], have weights less than 2. After reaching [[Sinnoh]], all three of those loot drop items would be impacted by the Dungeon Loot Regional Debuff and would become roughly 20x as rare. The odds of finding these three items still increases marginally with increasing dungeon clears - dungeon clears always decrease the chance of finding the highest tier items up to 500 clears. However, in general it is much better to go for drops before you are affected by the debuff.</text>
