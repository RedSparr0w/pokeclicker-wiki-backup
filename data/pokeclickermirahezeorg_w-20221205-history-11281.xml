== Description ==
'''Lum''' is a type of [[Berries|Berry]] that can be planted in [[Farm]]. It can be obtained by surrounding an empty plot with all 8 berries from page 1 in the ripe stage.

=== Important notes ===

The total growth time to achieve a field full of ripe Gen 1 berries is short at only ten minutes (without modifiers), but the Lum berry can be challenging to obtain. This is primarily due to the high mutation rates of unwanted berries that can mutate on center space, as well as the short ripe-death time of Gen 1 berries. It is common to go through many full cycles of this growing process before a single Lum berry has been successfully mutated. As the growth time is so short, if you use the Sprayduck be sure to switch it to a different [[Oak Item]] as soon as the Cheri berry is ripe. Furthermore, while getting two cycles of Cheri berry ripeness is possible in one Sitrus cycle, it is often difficult to coordinate this timing with the other berries. When all 8 berries are ripe, be sure to apply a [[Farm Items|Surprise Mulch]] to the center plot and [[Farm Items|Shovel]] any unwanted berries as they appear. Diligently watching your plots during this process may dramatically reduce the number of Lum attempts necessary to achieve the mutation.
