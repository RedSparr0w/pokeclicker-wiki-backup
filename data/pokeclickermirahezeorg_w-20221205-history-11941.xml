    <text bytes="21483" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.

    <text bytes="21403" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Categorized Tasks ==

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.

== Categorized Tasks ==

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.

== Dream tasks ==

# add a growth table for each berry timing with both maxed sprayduck amd boost mulch active.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with boost mulch alone.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with both boost mulch &amp; maxed sprayduck.

# add the chain of berries that a berry have to follow in order to get mutated (the sequence you need to follow from page 1 berry if you dont have any later berries)
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
