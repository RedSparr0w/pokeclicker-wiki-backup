    <text space="preserve" bytes="7047">Quests can be completed to earn [[Quest Points]], which can in turn be used to purchase [[Eggs]], [[Evolution Items]], and other collectibles. Their value is also effected by a randomization procedure making them able to be only 90% of their calculated value or up to 110% of the calculated value. Quests can be randomly generated as part of a list as explained in the Normal Quest Types section, or be part of a larger Questline that requires the player to follow certain steps to complete them. For more information about these other kinds of Quests, please check the [[Questlines]] page.

=Slots and Quest XP=

By completing quests (even those part of questlines such as the tutorial), the player is rewarded with quest experience.

Each quest gives experience according to the following formula:

&lt;math&gt; Quest Experience = 100 + \frac{QP Reward}{100} &lt;/math&gt;

Quests are also associated with a leveling system. The cumulative amount of experience to reach any given level follows the formula below:

&lt;math&gt; Quest Level Experience = 5000 \times (1.2^{(level - 1)} - 1) &lt;/math&gt;

Extra quest slots are awarded at certain quest level thresholds. Quest slots allow for multiple quests to be undertaken simultaneously. The maximum number of slots one can have is 4. Though the exact amount of quest experience one has is not visible in the game, XP requirements have been included for reference.

Capture type quest reward works like this:

reward = questAmount * CAPTURE_POKEMONS_BASE_REWARD * weights[type].weight ... it's that last part that makes this confusing.  It's there to change the reward based on what types you can easily access

questAmount = between 50 and 250
CAPTURE_POKEMONS_BASE_REWARD = DEFEAT_POKEMONS_BASE_REWARD / 0.74
              DEFEAT_POKEMONS_BASE_REWARD  = questBase * 1
              questBase = 1
     CAPTURE_POKEMONS_BASE_REWARD = 1/0.74 = 1.35
weights[type].weight is much harder to explain.  In code, it is:
          types.map(v =&gt; ((-v + max) / max) * (this.maxWeight - this.minWeight))   
In English, it says:
          ( (-TotalCountOfTypeThatThePlayerCanEnounterAtThisTime + totalNumberOfEncounters)/totalNumberOfEncounters) * (4.0 - 1.2)
and then it is rounded to 2 decimal places

putting it together, we have:
Pokemon * 1.35 * (Number specific to the individual, based on progress in the game) * 2.8
So, I'm just going to pretend that that middle part doesn't matter, and so it's just Pokemon * 3.78.  It's close enough to the numbers I'm measuring in game

† Note: these quests change their reward based on how far the player has progressed.  If for instance, the player receives a quest to capture fairy type pokemon, and very few are available, the reward should be more to reflect the difficulty.  This is similar to how the gem quest reward changes based on difficulty.</text>
