    <text bytes="924" space="preserve">After all 18 berries are ripe, the requirements for Petaya to spawn have been fully met. At this point, immediately switch out your [[Sprayduck]] for the [[Squirtbottle]], if possible, otherwise another [[Oak Item]] if not. It is highly recommended that you make a save here so you don't have to go through the whole setup again in case nothing mutates. Petaya can spawn on any of the seven open plots in your farm. The seven empty plots should all be permanently applied with surprise mulch. Note that even though the [[Kebia]] has the ability to overtake other berries, it can only do so at the taller or later stages, so you will be able to let the mutation keep going if you want to mutate multiple petayas before the [[Wacan]] withers. Specifically, you have 6 hours from time of mutation to remove the [[Kebia]] before it threatens to take over your newly mutated petaya unless it mutates on one of the two edge plots.</text>
