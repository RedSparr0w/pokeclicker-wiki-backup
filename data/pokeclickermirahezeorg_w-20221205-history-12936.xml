    <text bytes="1402" space="preserve">'''Oak Items''' are special items given to the player by [[Professor Oak]] as they progress through the game.
These items act as permanent upgrades to the player's account.

==Usage==
Each Oak Item is a permanent upgrade to the player's account. They buff stats and can be upgraded with constant use. 
Much like acquiring the items, player's start out with one slot that can be used to activate an Oak item. As players catch more Pokémon, more slots are unlocked. 
They are as following
{| class="roundtable sortable" style="background: #{{items color light}}; border:3px solid #{{items color dark}}"
! Slot
! Pokémon&lt;br&gt;Required
|-
| 1
| 20
|-
| 2
| 50
|-
| 3
| 100
|}

==Aquasition==
Oak Items are gained by playing through the game by capturing certain numbers of Pokémon.
