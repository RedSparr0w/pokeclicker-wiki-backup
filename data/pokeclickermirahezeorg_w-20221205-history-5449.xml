EVs are a damage multiplying stat for each individual Pokémon that can be seen in the Pokédex page for that Pokémon and by using the ''Display Value'' setting in the Hatchery. EVs for a Pokémon can currently only be increased by obtaining that Pokémon again after it has caught the Pokérus. You can gain EVs for a Pokémon by: catching it on a [[Route Statistics|Route]] or a [[Dungeon]], obtaining it as a [[Wandering Pokemon]], or by evolving it using [[Evolution Items]]. [[Breeding]] a Pokémon does not count towards gaining EVs. EV gain is further affected by the [[Rowap|Rowap Berry Aura]]. See [[Farming Setups#Maximizing EV Gain|Farming Setups]] for an optimized EV gain farm setup.</text>
