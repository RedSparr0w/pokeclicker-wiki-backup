The '''Pokémon Day Care''' is a location in [[Kanto]] where [[Eggs]] and [[Fossils]] can be bred. Additionally, obtained [[List of Pokémon with attack|Pokémon]] that have reached level 100 can be bred to receive an Attack bonus equal to 25% of its Base Attack.  The Pokémon Day Care is unlocked upon clearing '''Route 5''' of [[Kanto]].

One quest that can appear involves hatching a random amount of Eggs. These can be either purchased from [[Shops]], or from breeding level 100 Pokémon.

=Usage=

As soon as [[Kanto#Routes|Route 5]] is cleared, the Pokémon Day Care can be accessed by clicking on its location on the map on Route 5. Additionally, the Hatchery tab becomes available on the main page.

There are three different types of hatch-able resources in Pokéclicker: obtained Pokémon Eggs, Fossils, and already obtained level 100 Pokémon. Pokémon Eggs are typically purchased in Shops and Fossils are typically mined from the [[Underground]]. The Egg/Fossil/Obtained Pokémon that can be bred each have their own distinct tab in the Pokémon Day Care modal. 

Clicking on the desired Egg/Fossil/Level 100 Pokémon will result in it being added to the Hatchery. The Hatchery only has 4 slots, but Breeding Queue slots can be unlocked in each new [[Regions|Region]] (See Upgrades Below). The Breeding Queue automatically adds queued Pokémon to the Hatchery if there is space. If there is a Pokémon in the queue, Eggs/Fossils that are ready to hatch will do so and be replaced by the queued Pokémon.

Each Pokémon has a certain number of Egg Steps required before it can hatch from an Egg. Consult [[List of Pokémon with attack]] for egg steps for all Pokémon. Egg Steps are gained through defeating Pokémon. [[Route Statistics|Routes]], [[Gyms]], and [[Dungeons]] all yield different numbers of Egg Steps per Pokémon defeated, although the Egg Steps yielded generally scales with the difficulty of the Route, Gym, or Dungeon.

When an Egg/Fossil in the Hatchery has obtained the required number of Egg Steps, as indicated by the green progress bar on each Egg/Fossil, it will be ready to hatch. Clicking on the image of the Egg/Fossil with hatch it, giving the player one of that Pokémon. 

[[Baby Pokémon]] are Pokémon obtained exclusively through Breeding the evolved stage of that Pokémon. The first time a Baby Pokémon is hatched the player will obtain both the original evolved stage, and the baby stage of that Pokémon.

The 25% increase to a Pokémon's Base Attack through breeding can be increased through the use of [[Protein]]. Proteins increase the Attack bonus from Breeding by 1 for each Protein used on an individual Pokémon. Consult [[Protein]] for further information on Breeding Efficiency using Proteins.

Breeding Pokémon offers much higher shiny odds than any other method of obtaining Pokémon in the game at 1/1024 using the Shiny Charm. Consult [[Shiny Chance]] for further information on Shiny Odds using the Hatchery.

=Efficiency=

There are 3 key aspects to consider when breeding Pokémon towards a specific goal.

#The 'Breeding Efficiency' of that Pokémon (including the number of proteins used on that Pokémon)
#The [[Region]] that Pokémon is found in the Pokédex
#The type of Pokémon you should breed to accomplish that goal

For example, let's say I am trying to defeat Champion Wallace in Hoenn. While the Pokémon with the highest Breeding Efficiency overall is Gyarados, when accounting for the 30% damage debuff for a Kanto Pokémon in the Hoenn region it is merely the 11th most efficient Pokémon to breed. Therefore breeding Azurill, the most efficient Pokémon to breed in Hoenn, will be slightly more efficient overall to defeat Wallace. Furthermore, breeding some of the Hoenn Grass type Pokémon (e.g. Tropius, Breloom, Shroomish, Roselia, etc.) that are only slightly less efficient than Azurill is made up for by their type advantage over Wallace's primarily water type Pokémon. In conclusion, if trying to breed towards a goal focus on high breeding efficiency Pokémon that are from the region you are trying to beat with a type advantage against whatever Pokémon you are struggling to defeat.

=Upgrades=

Additional Breeding Queue slots can be obtained by progressing to the next region.

|-

|}

=Farm Strategies=

The farm can be utilized to increase the egg steps yielded by Pokémon through the use of [[Chople]] berries. However, as Chople berries surrounded by at least three other Chople berries can mutate into [[Chilan]] berries, specfic strategies must be employed to best plant Chople berries in order to increase egg steps. Below are several strategies that can be used depending on which berries are readily accessible, accompanied by a short description of each strategy's pros and cons as well as a corresponding planting diagram.

Note: Any Strategy that used Petaya will have a slightly different timing table. Once Petaya ripens it resets the timers of all other berries and sets them to infinity. Thus, other berries can be planted so that they ripen before Petaya, and should be timed so that Petaya ripens just before they wither.

==== Chople + Empty Rows ====

The easiest strategy for planting Chople berries is to leave empty rows separating each row of Chople berries. This is easy to do and requires no additional berries, but is also less efficient than other more complex strategies.

|}

==== Chople + [[Yache]]/[[Haban]] ====

A slightly more complex strategy for planting Chople berries is to plant berries that decrease growth rates ([[Yache]] or [[Haban]]) between each of the rows of Chople berries. While this takes Chople berries longer to grow, it also results in longer wither times for Chople berries. While this doesn't appear to be incredibly challenging to accomplish, and uses only 4th generation berries, the berries on the ends of each row receive a diminished growth aura effect relative to more central berries on the farm. This can make timing simultaneous ripeness of all berries on the farm challenging.

==== Chople + [[Petaya]] ====

A strategy that is easier in many respects than Chople + Yache/Haban is Chople + [[Petaya]]. Petaya is one of the final berries to unlock, and it is one of the most challenging to do so, so it might not be the most accessible option. However, the aura effect of Petaya berries "freeze" the timers of ripe berries on the farm, locking them at infinity so long as the Petaya plant is ripe. This is an incredibly powerful effect as Petaya berries remain ripe for 5 days (no modifiers). Thus, this strategy provides a very stable setup for three rows of Chople berries for much longer than using two empty rows.

|}

==== Chople + [[Babiri]] ====

Another somewhat easy strategy is Chople + [[Babiri]]. Ripe Babiri berries prevent mutations in the berries they are near. Thus, once they are unlocked four strategically placed Babiri berries can allow for a more full farm of Chople berries.

|}

==== Chople + [[Lum]] ====

Another somewhat easy strategy is Chople + [[Lum]]. Ripe Lum berries boost the auras of the berries they are near (max of one boost for each nearby berry). Thus, once they are unlocked four strategically placed Lum berries can allow for a farm of Chople berries with increased boosts.

==== Chople + Lum + Petaya ====

Combines Chople + Lum with a Petaya for a longer duration boost.

==== Chople + Babiri + Petaya ====

This strategy combines Chople + Babiri and Chople + Petaya, utilizing the effects of each berry for a farm with one fewer Chople, but far more longevity. A Petaya berry and strategically placed Babiri berries prolong the ripe times and prevent mutations of all ripe berries on the farm.
