    <text bytes="15726" space="preserve">'''Berries''' can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The [[Berry Master]] NPC found at Cerulean City in [[Kanto]] provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating once they are in the Berry stage until they die. For mutations involving flavor requirements, the mutation can happen at any time after the requirements are met (berries have 0.5x flavor in the "grown" stage, 0.75x flavor in the "bloom" stage, and 1x flavor in the "berry" stage). If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

    <text bytes="14108" space="preserve">[[Berries]] can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The Berry Master NPC found at Cerulean City in Kanto provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

    <text bytes="14108" space="preserve">[[Berries]] can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The Berry Master NPC found at Cerulean City in Kanto provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

    <text bytes="14042" space="preserve">[[Berries]] can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The Berry Master NPC found at Cerulean City in Kanto provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

    <text bytes="13665" space="preserve">[[Berries]] can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The Berry Master NPC found at Cerulean City in Kanto provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

    <text bytes="13555" space="preserve">[[Berries]] can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The Berry Master NPC found at Cerulean City in Kanto provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

    <text bytes="12554" space="preserve">[[Berries]] can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The Berry Master NPC found at Cerulean City in Kanto provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.

    <text bytes="11887" space="preserve">[[Berries]] can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farming Points|Farm Points]]. Certain berries can be traded for [[Masterball|Masterballs]], [[Protein]], and other [[Evolution Items]] at [[Berry Master]] shops. The [[Sprayduck]], [[Squirtbottle]], and [[Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

Some Berries require mutation, or planting Berries according to specific conditions, to be unlocked. The Berry Master NPC found at Cerulean City in Kanto provides hints on how to trigger mutations. Certain mutations depend on flavor profiles, specific types of berries, or other factors, some of which are outside of the farm.

=Growth Charts=

Berries can start mutating from the "Grown" stage onwards, unless otherwise stated in that berry's hint code. For mutations involving multiple plants, all of them must be "Grown" or older to trigger. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.
