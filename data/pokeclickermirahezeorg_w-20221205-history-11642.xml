    <text bytes="1651" space="preserve">'''Roaming Pokémon''' are rare Pokémon that can be found randomly while on routes.
Each [[Region|region]] has a set of Roaming Pokémon that can be caught.
So far, only Mew and Manaphy have no requirements to appear.

==Odds==

''For a breakdown of roaming chances on every route, visit the [[Route Statistics]] page.''

The chance to encounter a roaming Pokémon is 1/8192 for the first route of a region, and increases linearly up to 1/4096 for the last route of a region.
"First" and "last" here refer to the health of the Pokémon on these routes, not necessarily the order they are unlocked. This means that a route you can 1-shot will always be at least as efficient as a route you can't, so it is recommended to idle on the highest route number you can 1-shot if you need them.
