'''Petaya''' is a type of [[Berries|Berry]] that can be planted in the [[Farm]]. It can be obtained by having at least one empty plot and at least 1 of every [[Berries#Gen 4 Berries|Gen 4 berry]] on the field.

=== Mutation Strategy ===
==== Possible Planting Formations ====

You can fill your farm in the following way to obtain Petaya berries. Note that the [[Occa]], [[Kebia]] and [[Colbur]] can overtake other plants and are placed separately. [[Kebia]] and [[Payapa]] increase mutation chance and are placed centrally to affect the highest amount of mutation plots. [[Babiri]] decreases mutation chance and [[Rindo]] expands to open plots, so they are not placed near mutation plots. [[Wacan]], [[Yache]] and [[Haban]] all affect growth times and are placed at the side with shorter growth time berries to limit their impact and make the timings easier. Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur.

==== Important notes ====

Before you start this process, you need to be prepared to spend around 11 hours or more close to your device with Pokéclicker. 

* Using the timings listed in the table to the right will cause all berries to ripen within 10 minutes of each other. Each time stamp indicates when you should plant the berry listed together with it.

* The timings assume an equipped max level [[Sprayduck]] and boost mulch for the whole duration on all berry plots except for the [[Chilan]], [[Tanga]], [[Wacan]], [[Kasib]], and [[Kebia]]. Use no boost mulch for the Kasib and Kebia, 5 boost mulch for Chilan and 6 boost mulch for Tanga and Wacan. All boost mulch should be applied immediately on planting. In total, you need 1200-1500 boost mulch to complete the entire process. It is however highly recommended to have at least 1500 boost mulch in your inventory before starting planting, in case of something going wrong.

* You will need to set 16 simultaneous timers (there are 17 berries to be planted after starting the timer, but two of the berries are planted at the same time). The free website [https://www.timeanddate.com/timer/ timeanddate.com] is an excellent resource for setting many simultaneous timers.

* The timing starts at planting of the first berry. At the exact same time as you plant [[Haban]], start all your timers.

* Note that there are only three breaks longer than one hour between planting of berries; between [[Haban]] and [[Babiri]], between Babiri and [[Yache]], and between [[Coba]] and [[Chilan]].

===== Critical information for when all berries have ripened =====

After all 18 berries are ripe, the requirements for Petaya to spawn have been fully met. At this point, immediately switch out your [[Sprayduck]] for another [[Oak Item]]. Petaya can spawn on any of the seven open plots in your farm. The seven empty plots should all be permanently applied with surprise mulch. Note that the three berries planted at the highest row all have the ability to overtake other berries. This means that Petaya can spawn, instantly be overtaken by another berry, and then the entire rest of your farm also runs the risk of getting overtaken. For this reason, it is highly suggested to actively watch your farm at all times when all 18 berries are ripe.

===== What to do if Petaya doesn't spawn before other berries start dying =====

The berry that will die first is [[Wacan]] — it will die around 1 hour 20 mins after it ripens. This ''should'' be enough for you to get a Petaya to spawn, based on a small sample size of anecdotal evidence. If it doesn't, however, you need to replant berries instantly after they die. [[Chilan]], Wacan and [[Tanga]] all have growth times shorter than two hours with [[Sprayduck]] equipped and boost mulch applied, meaning that even if all three of them die, there is still enough time for you to get several hours more of opportunities for Petaya to spawn.
