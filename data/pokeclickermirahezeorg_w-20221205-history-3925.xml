    <text bytes="438" space="preserve">If [[Wacan]] dies, harvest and replant [[Chilan]], [[Tanga]], and [[Wacan]] following this table to get the setup again. Note that you will want to make sure [[Coba]] and [[Shuca]] have at least about 2 hours 46 mins left on their timers (3 hours 26 mins without boost mulch) for another full [[Wacan]] cycle. You may want to replant [[Kasib]] as well to avoid [[Shuca]] dying before [[Coba]], but this is not very important at this time.</text>
