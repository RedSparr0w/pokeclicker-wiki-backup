: Linking to the appropriate [[Gyms]] section is probably good enough in my opinion. I could see maybe adding the region, but again if you want to know where the gym is you can just click on the link for each leader. [[User:Jk13|Jk13]] ([[User talk:Jk13|talk]]) 20:51, 9 May 2022 (UTC)

Page needs to be updated for Kanto encounters and gyms being changed to red/green rather than yellow. I believe all the changes are 
Blaine now has 4/4 fire types up from 3/3
Lt surge should be added to electric gem list as he now has 3/3 electric types up from 1/1
Giovanni has 5/5 ground types up from 4/5
Sabrina has 3/4 psychic types down from 3/3
Koga should be removed from bug gem list as he now has 0/4 bug types down from 4/4
Giovanni seems to already have been updated from 1/5 rock types to 2/5</text>
