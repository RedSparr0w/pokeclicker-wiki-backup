Yes! Once an obtained Pokémon is shiny, it will always remain shiny.

===If I evolve a shiny Pokémon will the evolution be shiny?===
Maybe, there is a 1/2048 [[Shiny Chance|chance]] a Pokémon will evolve into a Shiny. You will probably need to obtain the shiny evolution via a different method (e.g. breeding, stone evolutions, Dungeons, etc.).

==Items:==

===What is the small/medium/large restore used for?===
They can be used in the [[Underground]] to restore stamina.

===What are berries used for?===
[[Berries]] have a wide variety of uses due to their special Auras, the [[Wandering Pokémon]] they can recruit, and the ability to be traded for rare items such as exclusive [[Pokéballs]], [[Protein|Proteins]], and [[Masterball|Masterballs]] with [[Berry Master|Berry Masters]] in various regions.

===Why is the Rare Candy so expensive?===
They don't currently have a use, once a use is implemented the price will be adjusted.

==Gameplay:==

===How many [[Regions]] are playable?===
Currently, Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos are able to be played.

===How do I get to the next region?===
You must obtain all Pokémon available in the current region.
Note: Once you get to the next region you will not be able to go back to previous regions until you reach the dock again.

===Where did the upgrades go?===
They are no longer a part of the game, But [[Oak Items]] have been reworked to provide upgrades.

===Can I progress towards more than 1 [[Quests|Quest]] at a time?===
Yes, you can unlock up to 4 quest slots.
*Quest Level 1: 1 slot.
*Quest Level 10: 2 slots.
*Quest Level 15: 3 slots.
*Quest Level 20: 4 slots.

===Where is x location?===
Underground: Route 11.

*Farm: Unlock [[Kanto#Routes|Route 14]] and obtain [[Berries]].

===Why should I be breeding Pokémon?===
When a Pokémon is hatched its attack will increase by 25% of its '''base''' amount. While breeding is not initially necesary, by later regions it is imperative for progression. Additionally, some Pokémon can only be obtained by breeding. Finally, Breeding has higher odds of obtaining a shiny Pokémon (1/1024).

===How do I obtain x Pokémon?===
Check you have completed every [[Regions|route]].
Check each [[Dungeons|dungeon]] has been completed.
Some Pokémon only come from [[Eggs]].
Some can only be obtained by using an [[Evolution Items|Evolution Item]].
Some can only be found in the [[Safari Zone]].
Aerodactyl can only be obtained with an Old Amber from the [[Underground]] or from the Old Amber Quest.
Some can only be purchased from a [[Shops|Shop]].
Some legendaries will only appear randomly on routes as [[Roaming Pokémon]].

Note: Once you get to the next region you will not be able to go back to previous regions until you reach the dock again.

===Where did the upgrades go?===
They are no longer a part of the game, But oak items have been reworked to provide upgrades.

===Can I progress towards more than 1 quest at a time?===
Yes, you can unlock up to 4 quest slots.
Quest Level 10: 2 slots.
Quest Level 15: 3 slots.
Quest Level 20: 4 slots.

===Where is x location?===

==Where can I play the development version?==
https://www.pokeclicker.com/

==Saves:==

===Can I import my save from the previous version? (0.9.3)===
You can only import the shinies you obtained in the previous version.

(this will not count as capturing a new shiny Pokemon)

===Will my progress be carried over on release?===
Yes!

==Rare/Shiny Pokémon:==

===What are the odds of finding a roaming Pokémon?===
The chance to encounter a roaming Pokémon is 1/8192 for the lowest hp route of a region and increases linearly up to 1/4096 for the highest hp route of a region.

===What are the [[Shiny Chance#Odds|odds]] of finding a shiny Pokémon?===
*In the wild 1/8192
*In a dungeon 1/4096
*Using an evolution stone 1/2048
*From hatching an egg 1/1024

===Do shiny Pokémon give any bonus to gameplay?===
Yes, they boost your click attack by 50% of their standard version (e.g. 10 normal click attack -&gt; 15 Shiny click attack)

===Does the shiny form of a standard Pokémon I already have (but is not yet shiny) count as a "New Pokémon" in the Pokéball selection?===
If you have not obtained the shiny variant yet, they will count as a new Pokémon.

===If I breed a shiny Pokémon will it stay shiny?===

===If I evolve a shiny Pokémon will the evolution be shiny?===
Maybe, there is a 1/2048 [[Shiny Chance|chance]] a Pokémon will evolve into a Shiny. You will probably need to obtain the shiny evolution via a different method (e.g. breeding, stone evolutions, Dungeons, etc.).

==Items:==

===What is the small/medium/large restore used for?===
They can be used in the underground to restore stamina.

===Why is the Rare Candy so expensive?===
They don't currently have a use, once a use is implemented the price will be adjusted.

==Where can I play the development version?==
https://www.pokeclicker.com/

==Saves:==

===Can I import my save from the previous version? (0.9.3)===
You can only import the shinies you obtained in the previous version.
They will only appear in your Pokemon list once re-captured
(this will not count as capturing a new shiny Pokemon)

===Will my progress be carried over on release?===
Yes!

==Rare/Shiny Pokémon:==

===What are the odds of finding a roaming Pokémon?===
The chance to encounter a roaming Pokémon is 1/8192 for the lowest hp route of a region and increases linearly up to 1/4096 for the highest hp route of a region.

===What are the odds of finding a shiny Pokémon?===
In the wild 1/8192
In a dungeon 1/8192
Using an evolution stone 1/2048
From hatching an egg 1/1024

===Do shiny Pokémon give any bonus to gameplay?===
Yes, they boost your click attack by 50% of their standard version (e.g. 10 normal click attack -&gt; 15 Shiny click attack)

===Does the shiny form of a standard Pokémon I already have (but is not yet shiny) count as a "New Pokémon" in the Pokéball selection?===
If you have not obtained the shiny variant yet, they will count as a new Pokémon.

===If I breed a shiny Pokémon will it stay shiny?===
Yes! Once an obtained Pokémon is shiny, it will always remain shiny.

===If I evolve a shiny Pokémon will the evolution be shiny?===
No. You will need to obtain the shiny evolution via a different method (e.g. breeding, stone evolutions, Dungeons, etc.).

==Items:==

===What is the small/medium/large restore used for?===
They can be used in the underground to restore stamina.

===What are berries used for?===
[[Berries]] have a wide variety of uses due to the special auras that some have and the Wandering Pokémon they can recruit. Berries can also be traded for rare items such as exclusive Pokéballs, Proteins, and Masterballs with Berry Masters.

===Why is the Rare Candy so expensive?===
They don't currently have a use, once a use is implemented the price will be adjusted.

==Gameplay:==

===How many regions are playable?===
Currently, Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos are able to be played.

===How do I get to the next region?===
You must obtain all Pokémon available in the current region.
Note: Once you get to the next region you will not be able to go back to previous regions until you reach the dock again.

===Where did the upgrades go?===
They are no longer a part of the game, But oak items have been reworked to provide upgrades.

===Can I progress towards more than 1 quest at a time?===
Yes, you can unlock up to 4 quest slots.
Quest Level 10: 2 slots.
Quest Level 15: 3 slots.
Quest Level 20: 4 slots.

===Where is x location?===
Underground: Route 11.
Daycare: Route 5, or click List on the hatchery.
Farm: Route 14.

===How do I unlock x location?===
Underground: Buy the Explorer Kit from Cinnabar Island.
Daycare: Unlock Route 5.
Farm: Unlock Route 14 and obtain Berries.

===Why should I be breeding Pokémon?===
When a Pokémon is hatched its attack will increase by 25% of its '''base''' amount. While breeding is not initially necesary, by later regions it is imperative for progression. Additionally, some Pokémon can only be obtained by breeding. Finally, Breeding has higher odds of obtaining a shiny Pokémon (1/1024).

===How do I obtain x Pokémon?===
Check you have completed every [[Regions|route]].
Check each [[Dungeons|dungeon]] has been completed.
Some Pokémon only come from [[Eggs]].
Some can only be obtained by using an [[Evolution Items|Evolution Item]].
Some can only be found in the [[Safari Zone]].

[[Baby Pokémon]] are obtained by breeding their evolution.

==Development:==


===When will the development version be fully released?===
There probably won't be a "final release".

===Will more regions be added?===
