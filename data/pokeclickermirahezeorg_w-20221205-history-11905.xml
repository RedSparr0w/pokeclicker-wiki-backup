    <text bytes="21586" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
