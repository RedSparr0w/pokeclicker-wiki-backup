The '''Farm''' is a location in [[Kanto]] where [[Berries]] can be planted. Harvesting them yields [[Farming Points]] {{Farmpoints}} and more of the same type of Berry. Occasionally, mutations can occur when Berries are planted in certain configurations. The Farm is unlocked upon reaching Kanto '''Route 14''' and obtaining the [[Wailmer pail]].

Two [[Quests#Normal_Quests|Quests]] that can appear involve the usage of the Farm.

=Usage=

''For a breakdown of harvest yields, flavors, and mutation configurations for the various types of Berries, consult the Berries page.

Before completing Kanto, the Farm can be accessed by clicking on its location on the map between Routes 14 and Route 15. Upon reaching [[Johto]], it becomes available in the Shortcuts dropdown modal.

The eight Gen 1 Berries are dropped by defeated Pokémon on routes. They can be planted by selecting the desired type in the left-hand column and clicking on plots in the field on the right. Alternatively, the "Plant All" button can be clicked to plant the selected Berry in every empty plot.

Depending on the type of Berry planted, different lengths of time have to pass before they can be harvested. Individual plots can be clicked to be harvested, or the "Harvest All" button may be pressed to harvest every plot ready for harvesting.

When Berry plants become ripe, they will die after a set period of time if not harvested. When this happens, only 1/2 of the harvest is obtained. There is also a chance they will replant themselves, spawning a plant of the same berry in that plot. The Replant Rate can be augmented by using the [[Sprinklotad]] Oak Item.

Berries can be obtained by planting obtained Berries in special configurations. The [[Berry Master|Kanto Berry Master]] in [[Towns_%26_Cities#Kanto_Cities_&amp;_Towns|Cerulean City]] gives hints as to these configurations. The chance for mutations to occur can be augmented by the [[Squirtbottle]] Oak Item.

[[Farm Items|Mulch]] and  [[Farm Items|Berry Shovel]] can be bought in [[Towns_%26_Cities#Johto_Cities_&amp;_Towns|Goldenrod City]], [[Towns_%26_Cities#Hoenn_Cities_&amp;_Towns|Mauville City]], [[Towns_%26_Cities#Sinnoh_Cities_&amp;_Towns|Hearthome City]]. Mulches can be applied to Berry plants to speed up growth (Boost Mulch), increase harvest yield (Rich Mulch), increase mutation chance (Surprise Mulch), or all of the above with a slightly reduced boost for all three (Amaze Mulch). [[Farm Items|Berry Shovels]] can be used to clear occupied plots.

=Upgrades=

Extra plots can be unlocked by spending Farming Points and Berries to allow more Berries to grow simultaneously, up to a maximum of 25 total plots. The table below displays the cost to unlock each plot corresponding to the 5x5 grid of plots in the Farm.
