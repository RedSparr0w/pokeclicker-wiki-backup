    <text space="preserve" bytes="3547">Many players have chosen to speedrun Pokéclicker. The [[https://www.speedrun.com/pokeclicker Pokéclicker Speedrun.com]] page contains the most up to date information regarding speedruns of the game.

Currently (V0.8.9) there are three main categories of speedruns that have been attempted, they are as follows:
* '''Tutorial%''' - Timer stops upon completion of the Pewter City Gym (end of the [[Quests#Tutorial| Tutorial Questline]])
* '''Kanto Champion%''' - Timer stops upon defeating Champion Blue
* '''151 Pokémon%''' - Timer stops upon capturing all 151 Pokémon in the Kanto Pokédex

Within these three main categories there are three styles of play that are used, they are as follows:
* '''Normal''' - Manual Clicking is permitted, any amount of clicking per second (CPS) that is exceptionally high may require separate verification
* '''Clickless''' - Clicking is not permitted, for runs after V0.7.5 the [[Challenge Mode|"No Click Challenge" Mode]] must be enabled
* '''Autoclicker''' - An approved autoclicker is permitted (See [https://www.opautoclicker.com/ OPAutoclicker]) with a 100ms click interval. The Autoclicker program window must be shown with the correct click interval during the run at all times

Within these 9 options for runs there are a further 2 styles of play for each option, they are as follows:
* '''Codeless''' - The use of ANY codes are not allowed
* '''Codes''' - The use of approved codes are permitted

There are an abundance of runs for Speedrunners to attempt, and many categories that have yet to even be attempted. Please visit the [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Pokéclicker Discord] if you have any questions regarding Speedruns. Please note that any runs submitted via Speedrun.com will require a recording of the run for Verification.

==Trivia and Depreciated Run Categories==

Many different categories of Speedruns were theorized as possible, but were never attempted. Below is a table of these runs and their associated rulesets. An additional rule utilized prior to the introduction of "Challenge Modes" were the usage (or lack thereof) of XItems.
