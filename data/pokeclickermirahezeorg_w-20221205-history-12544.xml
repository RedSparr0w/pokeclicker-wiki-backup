These are as of Version 0.5.4

===Descriptions===

speedrun.com page will be linked here.  Also this will memorialize all first places throughout history.

Each of these categories will also have three forms.

Those being 
#Clickless%
#Manual%
#Autoclicker%
For the time being you can submit runs on the Discord, the leaderboards below will be updated once attempts are submitted, and confirmed by the community.

If in Manual% your cps is above 15.5 cps (Current WR) your run may be disqualified unless you can provide proof that you have successfully surpassed that click speed, and in which case you will hold the actual WR for Click Speed.

===Rules===
# Must have the video recorded in its entirety.
# The run timer starts once you '''catch''' your starter.
# Shiny% excludes the starter.
# Video must end on the Statistics Screen.
# Clock changes for Time based Pok√©mon is allowed.
# Glitches may be used if they aren't otherwise specified.
