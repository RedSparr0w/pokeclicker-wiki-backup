    <text bytes="339" space="preserve">Kalos is the sixth region and currently has 78 new Pokémon to catch, breed and hatch. Some currently unobtainable forms will be added in the future. Kalos' gyms and dungeons are quite tough but offer great rewards as well. At this stage it should be easily possible for the player to give every Pokémon the maximum amount of protein.&lt;br&gt;</text>
