    <text bytes="350" space="preserve">Sinnoh is the fourth region and 120 new Pokémon are waiting to be caught. The player will encounter some Pokémon that only evolve when they are in a certain area. One should pay attention to the hints from the local people. At this stage it is suggested to give maximum [[Protein|protein]] at least to the Pokémon that are actively being bred.&lt;br&gt;</text>
