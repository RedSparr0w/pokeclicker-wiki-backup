    <text bytes="5177" space="preserve">Quests can be completed to earn [[Quest Points]], which can in turn be used to purchase [[Eggs]], [[Evolution Items]], and other collectibles. Their value is also effected by a randomization procedure making them able to be only 90% of their calculated value or up to 110% of the calculated value.

=Slots and Quest XP=

By completing quests (even those part of questlines such as the tutorial), the player is rewarded with quest experience.

Each quest gives experience according to the following formula:
* 100 + ({{Questpoints}} Quest Point reward / 100)

Quests are also associated with a levelling system. The cumulative amount of experience to reach any given level follows the formula below:
* 5000 x (1.2^(level - 1) - 1), rounded up to the nearest integer

Extra quest slots are awarded at certain quest level thresholds. Quest slots allow for multiple quests to be undertaken simultaneously. The maximum number of slots one can have is 4. Though the exact amount of quest experience one has is not visible in the game, XP requirements have been included for reference.
