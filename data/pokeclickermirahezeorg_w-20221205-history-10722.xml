We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# '''PART''' [[Shard Case]] page created, needs to be formatted in the same way and use the same templates as the other [[Key Items]]. See [[Wailmer Pail]] for reference
# Add an Infobox to [[Shards]] displaying an image of the in game Shard Case
# Add an Infobox to [[Pokemon Day Care]] displaying an image of the in game Hatchery
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Update [[Underground]] Images
# Update [[Underground]] Efficiency Table

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# '''PART''' [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l74KcfoY3Qs97RLJLwnpJYWcy2RzQ79e?usp=sharing|Berry Flow Charts] created for most berries. Need Kasib, Colbur, Apicot, Lansat, Starf, and Enigma ideas + diagrams
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# in each region's page, add a walkthrough-like flowchart (preferably in text format) showing what unlocks what as a player progress on map.

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# '''PART''' [[Shard Case]] page created, needs to be formatted in the same way and use the same templates as the other [[Key Items]]. See [[Wailmer Pail]] for reference
# Add an Infobox to [[Shards]] displaying an image of the in game Shard Case
# Add an Infobox to [[Pokemon Day Care]] displaying an image of the in game Hatchery
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Update [[Underground]] Images
# Update [[Underground]] Efficiency Table

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# '''PART''' [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l74KcfoY3Qs97RLJLwnpJYWcy2RzQ79e?usp=sharing|Berry Flow Charts] created for most berries. Need Kasib, Colbur, Apicot, Lansat, Starf, and Enigma ideas + diagrams
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# in each region's page, add a walkthrough-like flowchart (preferably in text format) showing what unlocks what as a player progress on map.

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# '''PART''' [[Shard Case]] page created, needs to be formatted in the same way and use the same templates as the other [[Key Items]]. See [[Wailmer Pail]] for reference
# Add an Infobox to [[Shards]] displaying an image of the in game Shard Case
# Add an Infobox to [[Pokemon Day Care]] displaying an image of the in game Hatchery
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Update [[Underground]] Images
# Update [[Underground]] Efficiency Table

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# '''PART''' [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l74KcfoY3Qs97RLJLwnpJYWcy2RzQ79e?usp=sharing|Berry Flow Charts] created for most berries. Need Kasib, Colbur, Apicot, Lansat, Starf, and Enigma ideas + diagrams
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# in each region's page, add a walkthrough-like flowchart (preferably in text format) showing what unlocks what as a player progress on map.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# '''PART''' Wandering Pokémon added to main berry page, consider adding uniquely attracted Pokémon to each berry infobox
# Add a list of all the berries in each berries which need that berry for mutations. Such as list all berries that need Razz berry to mutate in the Razz berry page.

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# '''PART''' [[Shard Case]] page created, needs to be formatted in the same way and use the same templates as the other [[Key Items]]. See [[Wailmer Pail]] for reference
# Add an Infobox to [[Shards]] displaying an image of the in game Shard Case
# Add an Infobox to [[Pokemon Day Care]] displaying an image of the in game Hatchery

    <text bytes="12274" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# '''PART''' Wandering Pokémon added to main berry page, consider adding uniquely attracted Pokémon to each berry infobox
# Add a list of all the berries in each berries which need that berry for mutations. Such as list all berries that need Razz berry to mutate in the Razz berry page.
# update Efficiency in underground page, until updated mention that this efficiency is no longer correct.
#  in [[Towns &amp; Cities]] page, write which city is on what route preferably in a table format.
# in [[Sprayduck]] page, the cost of lvling is not berries and should be changed to "harvested Plots".
# For Berries 9-20 add the purple color (example [[Roseli]]) to the planting diagram.
# Add encounter weights to every [[Dungeon]].
# Add trainers to every [[Dungeon]].

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# '''PART''' [[Shard Case]] page created, needs to be formatted in the same way and use the same templates as the other [[Key Items]]. See [[Wailmer Pail]] for reference
# Add an Infobox to [[Shards]] displaying an image of the in game Shard Case
# Add an Infobox to [[Pokemon Day Care]] displaying an image of the in game Hatchery
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Update [[Underground]] Images
# Update [[Underground]] Efficiency Table

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# '''PART''' [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l74KcfoY3Qs97RLJLwnpJYWcy2RzQ79e?usp=sharing|Berry Flow Charts] created for most berries. Need Kasib, Colbur, Apicot, Lansat, Starf, and Enigma ideas + diagrams
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# in each region's page, add a walkthrough-like flowchart (preferably in text format) showing what unlocks what as a player progress on map.
