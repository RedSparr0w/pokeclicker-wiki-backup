Attack is calculated as 100% of the total attack of all obtained Pokémon - the Regional Attack debuff is ignored. Attack can be further increased through modifiers such as [[Gems]] and XAttack. Battle Points and Pokémon Dollars are awarded upon defeat; the former can be used at the [[Battle Frontier#Battle Frontier Shop|Battle Frontier Shop]]. The higher the stage cleared, the more Battle Points are awarded. Frontier stages that have already been cleared in previous attempts will be cleared twice as fast in subsequent attempts - Pokémon Attack speed is doubled on cleared stages.</text>
