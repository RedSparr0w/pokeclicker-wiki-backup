    <text bytes="444" space="preserve">For a significantly longer uptime than [[Farming Setups#Roseli + Lum + Attracting Berry|Roseli + Lum + Attracting Berry]] to attract a Wandering Pok√©mon - perhaps if you're looking for a specific pokemon or group of pokemon to turn shiny for example - replace a Roseli Berry with a Petaya berry.  This doesn't decrease the encounter chance per second significantly, but it does make this setup viable for several days instead of several hours.</text>
