    <text bytes="11548" space="preserve">As you earn achievements, you gain up to 100% (per region) more [[Poké Dollar|Money]], [[Dungeon Tokens]] and Experience from all sources. The '''Achievement Tracker''' is unlocked after catching 110 total Pokémon. There is an additional 100% Achievement Bonus obtainable from non-regional Achievements. Thus, the maximum Achievement bonus at any time is always as follows: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Maximum Achievement Bonus} = \text{100%} \times \text{Region Number} + \text{100%} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
