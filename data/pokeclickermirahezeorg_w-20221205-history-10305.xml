'''Events''' are limited-time durations in which players are given the chance to capture unique Pokémon. Events usually occur in conjunction with real-world holidays (e.g. Halloween, Christmas), or coincide with the anniversary of important events in the Pokémon franchise (e.g. release of the first movie, release of ''Pokémon GO''). In most cases, the special Pokémon are added to region [[Roaming Pokémon|roamer]] pools.
