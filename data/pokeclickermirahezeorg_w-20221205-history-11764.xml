== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Page created, needs more info...Create a page about [[Pokedollar]], preferably with detailed information like [[Dungeon Tokens]].
# Create a [[Hatchery]] page.
# create a [[Key Items]] page listing all key items of the game.
# make [[Berry Master]] page better, its too blank and raw right now.
# in [[Berry Master]] page, add links to various key words.

=== Finishing Touches ===
# '''DONE''' in [[Dock]] page, add more information and image of dock.

=== Updating ===

=== Formatting ===
# '''DONE''' in [[Dungeon ticket]] page, make the image bigger in infobox, add link to shop. Add image of items before their names.

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# add a growth table for each berry timings with maxed sprayduck or boost mulch equipped, they both give same boost so only one table will show time for both conditions.
# add a growth table for each berry timing with both maxed sprayduck amd boost mulch active.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with boost mulch alone.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with both boost mulch &amp; maxed sprayduck.
# add timing table for berries that need multiple berries to be ripe at the same time.
# add the chain of berries that a berry have to follow in order to get mutated (the sequence you need to follow from page 1 berry if you dont have any later berries)
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region", "evo items" any more that can be put under same big heading.
# Upload all pokemon images non-shiny and shiny version.
# Add images of pokemon before their names in these pages

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Page created, needs more info...Create a page about [[Pokedollar]], preferably with detailed information like [[Dungeon Tokens]].
# Create a [[Hatchery]] page.
# create a [[Key Items]] page listing all key items of the game.
# make [[Berry Master]] page better, its too blank and raw right now.
# in [[Berry Master]] page, add links to various key words.

=== Finishing Touches ===
# '''DONE''' in [[Dock]] page, add more information and image of dock.

=== Updating ===

=== Formatting ===
# in [[Dungeon ticket]] page, make the image bigger in infobox, add link to shop. Add image of items before their names.

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# add a growth table for each berry timings with maxed sprayduck or boost mulch equipped, they both give same boost so only one table will show time for both conditions.
# add a growth table for each berry timing with both maxed sprayduck amd boost mulch active.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with boost mulch alone.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with both boost mulch &amp; maxed sprayduck.
# add timing table for berries that need multiple berries to be ripe at the same time.
# add the chain of berries that a berry have to follow in order to get mutated (the sequence you need to follow from page 1 berry if you dont have any later berries)
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region", "evo items" any more that can be put under same big heading.
