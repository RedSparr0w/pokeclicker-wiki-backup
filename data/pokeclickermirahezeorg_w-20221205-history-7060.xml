Spreading the Pokérus can only occur in the [[Pokémon Day Care]].  Currently, only a Pokémon infected with the Pokérus, and that's contagious, is able to spread it, and only manually breeding that Pokémon will allow the Pokérus to spread to other Pokémon with at least one type in common being manually hatched at the same time.  Or in other words, put your infected Pokémon as well as another Pokémon or three with at least one type in common you wish to infect in the day care, and so long as your starter Pokémon isn't ready to hatch yet, all other Pokémon currently being hatched (manually, no helpers) will be infected by the Pokérus.</text>
