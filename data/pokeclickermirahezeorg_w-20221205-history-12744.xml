===Uses===
The farm is a place that you can plant [[Berries]] that when harvested will give you Money and [[Farming Points]].  It can be upgraded to open more plots that allow you to plant more berries. The farm is unlocked by having the [[Wailmer Pail]], which is given to you when you unlock Route 14.
