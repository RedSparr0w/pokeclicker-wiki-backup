    <text bytes="631" space="preserve">Kanto is the first region and introduces the player to the core gameplay features. There are 151 unique Pokémon to catch and breed. Step by step the player gets introduced to the mechanics of [[Pokemon Day Care|breeding and hatching]] Pokémon, digging up items in the [[Underground]], growing [[Berries]] on the [[Farm]], finishing [[Quests]], the usage of [[Oak Items]], [[Gems]], and [[Achievements]].&lt;br&gt;
By giving [[Protein]] to obtained Pokémon the amount of added damage per breeding cycle is increased. Protein becomes available towards the end of Kanto at the [[Shops#Kanto: Locations &amp; Items|Indigo Plateau Kanto]].&lt;br&gt;</text>
