    <text bytes="284" space="preserve">Unova is the fifth region with 165 new Pokémon to catch. There are lots of dungeons in this region that require a substantial amount of Dungeon Tokens as well as damage. Breeding and hatching Pokémon that are native to this region for several days is quite common at this stage.&lt;br&gt;</text>
