    <text bytes="1310" space="preserve">This category is intended to contain all the "help" pages for this Wikia: pages that can help contributors and/or readers. Most, but not all, have "Help:" at the beginning of their page names and are therefore in the "Help" namespace; an automatically-generated list of those can be found at [[Special:Allpages]] by running down the "Namespace" menu. Many wikis also make much use of a [[Help:Contents]] page, where headings and tables may be used to cover the main areas, in contrast to a [[Special:Categories|category]], which is fairly rigidly based on alphabetical order.

If you find helpful pages that you think should be here, you may include them here just by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on them.

You can also:
* ask questions at the [[Forum:Index|forum]]
* talk to one of the [[Special:Listadmins|site administrators]] or any currently active contributor (the people whose names appear on [[Special:Recentchanges|the "Recent changes" page]]); use their User Talk pages.

If you can't find what you need on this wiki, you can seek help at the [[Wikia:Wikia|Central Wikia]].  There are more help pages at [[Wikia:Category:Help]], and you can use the [[Wikia:Forum:Index|Central forum]].  

If you still need help, you may want to contact the [[Wikia:Community Team|Wikia Community Team]].</text>
