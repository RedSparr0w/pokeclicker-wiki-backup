    <text bytes="1095" space="preserve">'''Roaming Pokémon''' are rare Pokémon that can be found randomly while on routes.
Each region has a set of Roaming Pokémon that can be caught.
So far, only Mew and Manaphy have no requirements to appear.

=='''Odds'''==
The chance to encounter a roaming Pokémon is 1/8192 for the first route of a region, and increases linearly up to 1/4096 for the last route of a region.
"first" and "last" here just being the route number, not necessarily the order you reach the route. This means that a route you can 1-shot will always be at least as efficient as a route you can't, so it is recommended to idle on the highest route number you can 1-shot if you need them.
A detailed list of roaming pokémon chances is listed on [[Route Statistics]].
