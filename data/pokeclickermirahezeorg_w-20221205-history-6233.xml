    <text bytes="507" space="preserve">'''Challenge Modes''' are in-game options to change the difficulty of the game.  There are currently 8 challenges, and once activated they cannot be deactivated on that save file.  There are no rewards for completing the challenges, other than for bragging rights.  The game is always designed to be 100% completable, even with all eight challenges active (although the methods may be different).  The recommended challenges are selected by default, however, you can click on them to disable that challenge.</text>
