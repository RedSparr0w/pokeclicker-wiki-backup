    <text bytes="582" space="preserve">*'''Example:''' [[Viridian Forest]] has six dungeon chest drops.  Three of those, [[Small Restore]], [[Grass Egg]], and [[Leaf Stone]] all have weights less than 2.  After reaching [[Sinnoh]] all three of those loot drop items would be impacted by the dungeon loot debuff and would become roughly 20x as rare. The odds of finding these three items still increases marginally with increasing dungeon clears - dungeon clears still decrease the chance of finding weight 4 items up to 500 clears. However, overall it is much better to go for drops before you are affected by the debuff.</text>
