    <text bytes="321" space="preserve">* It is very important that the [[Babiri]] finishes growing before the [[Occa]], [[Colbur]], and [[Kebia]]. As such, it is planted to finish very early since it also has a very long lifespan. When using the tables below, base your planting on the time left for [[Haban]] to finish. Don't use a different berry for timing.</text>
