[[Kasib]] berries will speed up the wither rates of all [[Rabuta]] and [[Payapa]] berries on the farm. The amount of time that Boost Mulch and the Sprayduck are active on the former two berries should be minimized to prevent excessive withering by the Kasib berry. However, the long wither times of both Rabuta and Payapa should prevent this potential Kasib withering increase from being an issue.</text>
