== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# Create a page about [[Pokedollar]], preferably with detailed information like [[Dungeon Tokens]].
# Create a [[Hatchery]] page.
# create a [[Key Items]] page listing all key items of the game.
# make [[Berry Master]] page better, its too blank and raw right now.
# in [[Berry Master]] page, add links to various key words.
# Upload images of all items that can be found in [[underground]].
# in [[Diamonds]] page, add images of all items before their names.
# in [[Diamonds]] page, remove link of each item in the table as there is no point of making a page for every individual item.
# in [[Diamonds]] page, add links to all the shops in masterball section.
# in [[Diamonds]] page, lift align the ""Total Cost" column.
