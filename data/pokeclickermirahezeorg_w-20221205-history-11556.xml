    <text bytes="10218" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Events]] page, ad more details about what events are and what we look for in planning new events if someone wanna propose any idea
# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# in [[Underground]] page, add a infobox on right showing the underground, update the efficiency section image with new underground image.
# Add alternate forms and event exclusive pokémon to [[List of Pokemons with attack]]
# Add Catch Rate column to all tables in [[List of Pokemons with attack]]
# Ensure all berry page infoboxes have a berrydex index in them

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Page created, needs more info...Add to [[Poke_Dollar|Pokedollar]] page, preferably detailed information like [[Dungeon Tokens]].
# Create a [[Hatchery]] page.
# make [[Berry Master]] page better, its too blank and raw right now.
# Create [[Shard Case]] page.
# Create [[Unova]] page (see other region pages for reference).
# Create all Unova dungeon pages

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Check and fix Egg Cycles, Attack Cycle, and Egg Steps for all Pokémon in [[List of Pokemons with attack]] (Note: This is due to the latest breeding patch)
# Add Unova [[Protein]] efficiency table
# Add Unova Towns and cities to [[Towns and Cities]]
# Add Unova NPCs to [[NPCs]]
# Add Unova shops to [[Shops]]
# Add Unova to [[Dungeon Tokens]]
# Add Unova routes to [[Route Statistics]]
# Add Unova purchase locations to all item pages
# Update all region route lists for optimal shard farming as of version 7.0.0

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# add a growth table for each berry timings with maxed sprayduck or boost mulch equipped, they both give same boost so only one table will show time for both conditions.
# add a growth table for each berry timing with both maxed sprayduck amd boost mulch active.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with boost mulch alone.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with both boost mulch &amp; maxed sprayduck.
# add timing table for berries that need multiple berries to be ripe at the same time.
# add the chain of berries that a berry have to follow in order to get mutated (the sequence you need to follow from page 1 berry if you dont have any later berries)
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region", "evo items" any more that can be put under same big heading.
# Upload all pokemon images non-shiny and shiny version.

    <text bytes="10183" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Events]] page, ad more details about what events are and what we look for in planning new events if someone wanna propose any idea
# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# in [[Underground]] page, add a infobox on right showing the underground, update the efficiency section image with new underground image.
# Add alternate forms and event exclusive pokémon to [[List of Pokemons with attack]]
# Add Catch Rate column to all tables in [[List of Pokemons with attack]]
# Ensure all berry page infoboxes have a berrydex index in them

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Page created, needs more info...Add to [[Poke_Dollar|Pokedollar]] page, preferably detailed information like [[Dungeon Tokens]].
# Create a [[Hatchery]] page.
# make [[Berry Master]] page better, its too blank and raw right now.
# Create [[Shard Case]] page.
# Create [[Unova]] page (see other region pages for reference).
# Create all Unova dungeon pages

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Check and fix Egg Cycles, Attack Cycle, and Egg Steps for all Pokémon in [[List of Pokemons with attack]] (Note: This is due to the latest breeding patch)
# Add Unova [[Protein]] efficiency table
# Add Unova Towns and cities to [[Towns and Cities]]
# Add Unova NPCs to [[NPCs]]
# Add Unova gyms to [[Gyms]]
# Add Unova shops to [[Shops]]
# Add Unova to [[Dungeon Tokens]]
# Add Unova routes to [[Route Statistics]]
# Add Unova purchase locations to all item pages
# Update all region route lists for optimal shard farming as of version 7.0.0

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# add a growth table for each berry timings with maxed sprayduck or boost mulch equipped, they both give same boost so only one table will show time for both conditions.
# add a growth table for each berry timing with both maxed sprayduck amd boost mulch active.

# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with both boost mulch &amp; maxed sprayduck.

    <text bytes="10003" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Events]] page, ad more details about what events are and what we look for in planning new events if someone wanna propose any idea
# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# in [[Underground]] page, add a infobox on right showing the underground, update the efficiency section image with new underground image.
# Add alternate forms and event exclusive pokémon to [[List of Pokemons with attack]]
# Add Catch Rate column to all tables in [[List of Pokemons with attack]]
# Ensure all berry page infoboxes have a berrydex index in them

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Page created, needs more info...Add to [[Poke_Dollar|Pokedollar]] page, preferably detailed information like [[Dungeon Tokens]].
# Create a [[Hatchery]] page.
# make [[Berry Master]] page better, its too blank and raw right now.
# Create [[Shard Case]] page.
# Create [[Unova]] page (see other region pages for reference).
# Create all Unova dungeon pages

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Check and fix Egg Cycles, Attack Cycle, and Egg Steps for all Pokémon in [[List of Pokemons with attack]] (Note: This is due to the latest breeding patch)
# Add Unova [[Protein]] efficiency table
# Add Unova Towns and cities to [[Towns and Cities]]
# Add Unova roamers to [[Roaming Pokémon]]
# Add Unova egg pokemon to [[Egg]]
# Add Unova NPCs to [[NPCs]]
# Add Unova gyms to [[Gyms]]
# Add Unova shops to [[Shops]]
# Add Unova to [[Dungeon Tokens]]
# Add Unova routes to [[Route Statistics]]
# Add Unova purchase locations to all item pages
# Update all region route lists for optimal shard farming as of version 7.0.0

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# add a growth table for each berry timings with maxed sprayduck or boost mulch equipped, they both give same boost so only one table will show time for both conditions.
# add a growth table for each berry timing with both maxed sprayduck amd boost mulch active.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with boost mulch alone.
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with both boost mulch &amp; maxed sprayduck.
# add timing table for berries that need multiple berries to be ripe at the same time.
# add the chain of berries that a berry have to follow in order to get mutated (the sequence you need to follow from page 1 berry if you dont have any later berries)
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region", "evo items" any more that can be put under same big heading.
# Upload all pokemon images non-shiny and shiny version.
# Add images of pokemon before their names in these pages
