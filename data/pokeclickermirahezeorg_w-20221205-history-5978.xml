    <text bytes="432" space="preserve">Berries can start mutating once they are in the Berry stage (fully Ripe) until they die. For mutations involving flavor requirements, the mutation can happen at any time after the requirements are met (berries have 0.5x flavor in the "grown" stage, 0.75x flavor in the "bloom" stage, and 1x flavor in the "berry" stage). If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.</text>
