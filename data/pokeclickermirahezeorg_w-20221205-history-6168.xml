This setup yield slightly fewer berries per harvesting cycle, in exchange for vastly increased Passho ripeness time. 
*Example: Despite the Petaya berry taking a slot away from a Passho berry, growing 10 Aguav berries would still yield 654 Aguav berries per harvesting cycle (1,311 with Rich Mulch). However, the Petaya berry will keep all Passho berries ripe for at least 64 hours. Farmhand Jessie could harvest 618,240 Aguav berries (harvesting in 4 minute cycles) over this time. 
You can also simply replace a Passho in one of the corners with a 2nd Petaya. When the first Petaya's wither time is getting close to the growth time of a Petaya minus the wither time of a Passho (10 hours with just sprayduck equipped, ~6 hours 40 minutes if you use boost mulch on the 2nd petaya as well as having the sprayduck equipped). When timed correctly, you can harvest the near-death Petaya and replace it with another Passho Berry to keep this formation up indefinitely.</text>
