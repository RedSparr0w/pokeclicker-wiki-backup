    <text bytes="766" space="preserve">This is the setup for harvesting the maximum amount of berries from any berry with a harvest amount of 1 or greater. The setup gives you 6 plots at 4.83x harvest rate, and 4 plots at 2.86x harvest rate. 
*Example: Using this setup, growing and harvesting 10 Aguav berries while all the Passho Berries are ripe will yield 684 Aguav Berries (1,372 with Rich Mulch) per harvesting cycle. In comparison, growing and harvesting 25 Aguav berries without any Passho Berries would yield 425 Aguav Berries (850 with Rich mulch) per harvesting cycle.  Using [[Farm Hands|Farmhand Jessie]] with the [[Sprayduck]] equipped to repeatedly harvest Aguav berries every 4 minutes would yield 40,356 berries (80,948 with Rich Mulch) for the duration of the Passho Berries' ripe phase.</text>
