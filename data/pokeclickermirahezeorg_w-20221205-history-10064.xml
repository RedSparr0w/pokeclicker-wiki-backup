===Description===
The Battle Frontier is a place in [[Hoenn]] where your Pokémon fight teams of three without any of your assistance.  [[Items]] are permitted however you cannot click to influence the outcome of the battle.

=== Details ===
Attack is calculated as 100% of the total attack of all obtained Pokémon, and can be increased further through modifiers such as [[Shards]] and [[XAttack]]. [[Battle Points]] are awarded upon defeat, which be used at the Battle Frontier Shop. More Battle Points are awarded the higher the round reached. Frontier stages that have already been cleared in previous attempts will be cleared twice as fast in subsequent attempts. Additionally, the amount of egg steps gained by a single Pokémon in the Battle Frontier is equal to: (stage)&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;. The combination of these two mechanics can lead to highly efficient breeding at high Frontier stages.
