The '''Safari Zone''' is an area in [[Kanto]] where the player may spend 100 [[Quest Points]] to try and catch unique [[Kanto]] Pokémon. Some Pokémon, like in the original games, only appear in the Safari Zone. 
The player receives 30 Safari balls. They have an option to either catch, throw a rock, bait the Pokémon, or flee. To unlock this area the Player must first have the [[Safari Ticket]].
Uncaught Pokémon have double the chance of appearing.

==Actions==
{| class="wikitable"
! Action !! Effect
|-
| Ball || Attempt to catch the Pokémon with a Safari Ball. Based on catch chance, this action may fail, after which the Pokémon might flee (based on escape chance), watch carefully / be angry (i.e. do nothing), or resume eating bait. Upon running out of Safari Balls, the player will be forced out of the Safari Zone, requiring them to pay the entrance fee again to re-enter.
|-
| Rock || Toss a rock at the Pokémon, removing "eating" status and making it angry for 2 - 7 turns. When angry, a Pokémon's catch chance and escape chance are both doubled.
|-
| Run || Flee the encounter and return to the Safari Zone overworld without penalty.
|-
| colspan=2 | All three types of bait give the Pokémon "eating" status, and removes "angry" status. While eating, a Pokémon's catch chance is halved, and its escape chance is quartered. Pokémon begin encounters with an escape chance of 30%.
|-
| Bait (generic) || Gives the Pokémon "eating" status for 2 - 7 turns. No other effects.
|-
| Bait ([[Razz]] [[Berry]]) || Gives the Pokémon "eating" status for 2 - 8 turns. Divides escape chance by 1.5 for the rest of the encounter unless another type of bait is used.
|-
| Bait ([[Nanab]] [[Berry]]) || Gives the Pokémon "eating" status for 2 - 8 turns. Boosts catch chance by 1.5x for the rest of the encounter unless another type of bait is used.
|}

Bait usage example
* Parasect encountered in the Safari Zone. Catch chance is '''12.5%''', escape chance is '''30%'''.
* Player's turn, Nanab Berry bait used. Catch chance boosted by 1.5x: 12.5 * 1.5 = '''18.75%'''. Escape chance is '''30%'''.
* Parasect is eating. Catch chance halved: 18.75 / 2 = '''9.375%'''. Escape chance quartered: 30 / 4 = '''7.5%'''.
* A few turns pass, and Parasect finishes eating. Eating bonuses are reverted, but Nanab bonus persists. Catch chance is '''18.75%''', escape chance is '''30%'''.</text>
