    <text bytes="2857" space="preserve">'''Flutes''' are a series of special items each with their own beneficial effect.
Flutes are gained by purchasing them from the Hoenn and Unova Gem Master shops.

==Usage==
Activating a flute happens when the Player clicks on the flute to activate it.  Flutes can be enabled / disabled whenever the player wants.  Each Flute buffs different properties in game, and requires 3 types of Gems to power their effects.  

Activating multiple Flutes simultaneously increases the cost in gems of keeping all Flutes active.  Each active Flute costs one Gem per second, per active Flute, from the Flutes three gem categories.  However, gem type costs don't overlap, thus, activating the Grass Flute (Grass, Bug, Fairy Gems) and the White Flute (normal, Bug, Rock Gems) requires 2 gems per second from the five gem types: Normal, Grass, Bug, Rock, and Fairy.  Keeping all 12 Flutes active thus costs 12 gems per second from every type of Gem.
