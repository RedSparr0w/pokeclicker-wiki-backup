These are as of Version 0.5.8

===Descriptions===

speedrun.com page will be linked here.  Also this will memorialize all first places throughout history.

Each of these categories will also have three forms, and 2 subcategories.

Those being 
#Clickless%
#Manual%
#Autoclicker%

With the 2 subcategories being
X-Item%
No X-Item%

For the time being you can submit runs on the Discord, the leaderboards below will be updated once attempts are submitted, and confirmed by the community.

If in Manual% your cps is above 15.5 cps (Current WR) your run may be disqualified unless you can provide proof that you have successfully surpassed that click speed, and in which case you will hold the actual WR for Click Speed.

Reminder that since the run timer doesn't start in Clickless% until you catch your starter, the 10 clicks required to get your starter do not count.

===Rules===
# Must have the video recorded in its entirety.
# The run timer starts once you '''catch''' your starter.
# Clock changes for Time based Pok√©mon is allowed.
# Glitches may be used if they aren't otherwise specified.

===Other Specifications===

If you need to take a break you may but before you go onto break you must end on your stats screen, and continue from the stats screen once you come back.  So as to prove no progress was made.

Shiny% excludes the starter.

Carpal Tunnel% must be ended on the statistics page so as to prove its 50,000 clicks.
