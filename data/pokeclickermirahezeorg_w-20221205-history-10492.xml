Professor Oak is the Main guiding character throughout the entirety of Pok√©Clicker, and acts as your tutorial guide through the Kanto region.  He also appears when you receive Key Items, which we can assume come from him.  Currently the only exceptions to this are the Explorer Kit and the Dungeon Ticket, which are bought from shops.
