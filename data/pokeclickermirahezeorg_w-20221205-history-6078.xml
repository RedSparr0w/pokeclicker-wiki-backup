    <text bytes="529" space="preserve">The farm can be utilized to increase the egg steps yielded by Pokémon through the use of [[Chople]] berries. However, as Chople berries surrounded by at least three other Chople berries can mutate into [[Chilan]] berries, specfic strategies must be employed to best plant Chople berries in order to increase egg steps.
