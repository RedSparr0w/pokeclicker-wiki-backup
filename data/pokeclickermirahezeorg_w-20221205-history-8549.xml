'''Petaya''' is a type of [[Berries|Berry]] that can be planted in the [[Farm]]. It can be obtained by having at least one empty plot and at least 1 of every [[Berries#Gen 4 Berries|Gen 4 berry]] on the field.

=== Mutation Strategy ===
==== Possible Planting Formations ====

You can fill your farm in the following way to obtain Petaya berries. Note that the [[Occa]], [[Kebia]] and [[Colbur]] can overtake other plants, so they are placed around a [[Babiri]] to prevent this. [[Kebia]] and [[Payapa]] increase mutation chance and are placed to affect the highest amount of mutation plots. [[Babiri]] decreases mutation chance and [[Rindo]] expands to open plots, so they are not placed near mutation plots. [[Wacan]], [[Yache]] and [[Haban]] all affect growth times and are placed in the corner with shorter growth time berries to limit their impact and make the timings easier. Using [[Farm_Items|Surprise Mulch]], a fully leveled up [[Squirtbottle]], and following this layout, you have roughly an 89.6% chance (59.57% chance without [[Squirtbottle]]) of acquiring a Petaya before the first berry needs to be replanted.  Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur.

==== Important notes ====

Before you start this process, you need to be prepared to spend around 11 hours or more close to your device with Pokéclicker or at least be able to pause your timers to take breaks. 

* Using the timings listed in the table to the right will cause all berries to ripen within 10 minutes of each other. Each time stamp indicates when you should plant the berry listed together with it.

* The timings assume an equipped max level [[Sprayduck]] and the detailed amount of boost mulch on the specified plots. All boost mulch should be applied immediately on planting. In total, you need 180 boost mulch to complete the entire process; however, it is highly recommended to have at least 250 boost mulch in your inventory in case of something going wrong. Note that even though the [[Babiri]] will ripen about the same time as the [[Haban]] with only 35 boost mulch, this is a very tight window. More is added to guarantee that it completes first to avoid the chance of other berries being taken over by [[Occa]], [[Colbur]], or [[Kebia]].

* The free website [https://www.timeanddate.com/timer/ timeanddate.com] is an excellent resource for setting many simultaneous timers. Timing starts at planting of the first berry. At the exact same time as you plant [[Haban]] and [[Babiri]], start all your timers.

* Note that there are few breaks longer than one hour; Farm timers do not run while the game is not open so you can take breaks throughout this process.

===== Critical information for when all berries have ripened =====

After all 18 berries are ripe, the requirements for Petaya to spawn have been fully met. At this point, immediately switch out your [[Sprayduck]] for another [[Oak Item]]. It is highly recommended that you make a save here so you don't have to go through the whole setup again in case nothing mutates. Petaya can spawn on any of the seven open plots in your farm. The seven empty plots should all be permanently applied with surprise mulch. Note that even though the [[Kebia]] has the ability to overtake other berries, it can only do so at the taller or later stages, so you will be able to let the mutation keep going if you want to mutate multiple petayas before the [[Wacan]] withers. Specifically, you have 6 hours from time of mutation to remove the [[Kebia]] before it threatens to take over your newly mutated petaya unless it mutates on one of the two edge plots.

===== What to do if Petaya doesn't spawn before other berries start dying =====

The berry that will die first is [[Wacan]] — it will die around 1 hours 25 mins after it ripens. This ''should'' be enough for you to get a Petaya to spawn. If the [[Wacan]] dies before mutation, you will have to replant [[Chilan]], [[Tanga]], and [[Wacan]] using boost mulch. If you start within 20 minutes of [[Wacan]] dying, you ''should'' be able to get one more full [[Wacan]] cycle before the [[Coba]] dies and you have to start over. The ability to do this increases overall chance of mutation to 98.9% or 83.65% without [[Squirtbottle]].

If [[Wacan]] dies, harvest and replant [[Chilan]], [[Tanga]], and [[Wacan]] following this table to get the setup again. Note that you will want to make sure [[Coba]] and [[Shuca]] have at least about 3 hours 45 mins left on their timers for another full [[Wacan]] cycle.
