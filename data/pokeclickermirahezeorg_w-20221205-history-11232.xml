    <text bytes="11689" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# in [[Underground]] page, add a infobox on right showing the underground, update the efficiency section image with new underground image.
# Figure out a way to detail changes to the wandering pokémon pool based on the berry type currently ripe on the farm (Add to each berry page in the infobox?)
# Add the Cover and Plume Fossil underground tile images (in block format like the other fossils) to [[Fossils]]

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# Create [[Shard Case]] page.
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# '''PART''' [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l74KcfoY3Qs97RLJLwnpJYWcy2RzQ79e?usp=sharing|Berry Flow Charts] created for most berries. Need Kasib, Colbur, Maranga, Petaya, Apicot, Lansat, Starf, and Enigma ideas + diagrams
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# Upload all pokemon images non-shiny and shiny version.

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# in [[Underground]] page, add a infobox on right showing the underground, update the efficiency section image with new underground image.
# Figure out a way to detail changes to the wandering pokémon pool based on the berry type currently ripe on the farm (Add to each berry page in the infobox?)
# Add the Cover and Plume Fossil underground tile images (in block format like the other fossils) to [[Fossils]]

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

    <text bytes="11701" space="preserve">Welcome to our To-Do list where we try and keep a track of everything which needs fixing/updating/adding/removing and anything else in any of the pages of the wiki. If you see something that needs to be done on any of the pages, feel free to edit this page and it in the below list or simply drop a message in our [https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p Discord] and someone else will do it.
&lt;br&gt;

We aim to one day have this page empty but it is not so easy unless everyone contributes a little.
&lt;br&gt;

Please do not delete the task if done, just write (DONE) before it so that one of the moderators can verify it.

== Uncategorized Tasks ==

# in [[Type and shard effectiveness]] page, the "practicality" section of the page need a clearer text explanation.
# in [[Underground]] page, add a infobox on right showing the underground, update the efficiency section image with new underground image.
# Figure out a way to detail changes to the wandering pokémon pool based on the berry type currently ripe on the farm (Add to each berry page in the infobox?)
# Add the Cover and Plume Fossil underground tile images (in block format like the other fossils) to [[Fossils]]

== Categorized Tasks ==

These task are also put together with like tasks so multiple tasks on one page can be done by 1 person all at once rather than multiple people over a long period of time because of misplaced information.

''Page Creation'' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information, adding lots of images to pages, or just large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
''Finishing Touches'' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
''Updating'' is for pages that were afflicted by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
''Formatting'' is for pages that would need to have their infoboxes changes, the way the information is display, or the general aesthetic changed.

=== Page Creation ===
# '''PART''' Created [[Pokemon Day Care]] page, needs image of the Hatchery modal and revisions/additions to the text.
# make [[Berry Master]] page better, its too blank and raw right now.
# Create [[Shard Case]] page.
# Add acquisition table to all [[Evolution Items]] (see [[Dragon Egg]] for reference)

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so long and such low priority that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# add a growth table for each berry timings with maxed sprayduck or boost mulch equipped, they both give same boost so only one table will show time for both conditions (see example page [[Roseli]])
# add a growth table for each berry timing with both maxed sprayduck and boost mulch active (see example page [[Roseli]])
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with boost mulch alone (see example page [[Roseli]])
# Write how many total boost mulch each berry need to have the boost active with both boost mulch &amp; maxed sprayduck (see example page [[Roseli]])
# add timing table for berries that need multiple berries to be ripe at the same time (see example page [[Roseli]])
#* JK13 Note: for Tasks 1-5 Berries 1-35, 53, 63, and 66 are '''DONE'''
# '''PART''' [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l74KcfoY3Qs97RLJLwnpJYWcy2RzQ79e?usp=sharing|Berry Flow Charts] created for most berries. Need Kasib, Colbur, Maranga, Petaya, Apicot, Lansat, Starf, and Enigma ideas + diagrams
# check every page that use PokeCoin.png and make the image appear after the amount.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# Upload all pokemon images non-shiny and shiny version.
# Add images of pokemon before their names in these pages
