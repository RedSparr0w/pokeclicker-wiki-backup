    <text bytes="569" space="preserve">Mutating Berries is a fairly simple process - plant berries in the correct setup and at the proper timings, wait for berries to be ripe, and then hope that RNG favors you.  Generally speaking, for a mutation to occur the berries required for a mutation to occur must all be ripe on the farm simultaneously.  Thus, on each individual berry page, you will find an Optimized Planting Formation to maximize your chances of a mutation occurring, as well as a Timing Chart, to help you plant berries at the correct times such that all berries will become ripe simultaneously.</text>
