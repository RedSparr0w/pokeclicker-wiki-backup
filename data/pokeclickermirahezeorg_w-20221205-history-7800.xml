== Stats ==
Hatchery Helpers have 3 important stats: '''Cost, Step Efficiency and Attack Efficiency''' (see below).  At this time, Hatchery Helpers don't Cost you anything when there are no eggs to hatch.  Each individual Hatchery Helper gains Step Efficiency and Attack Efficiency the more Pokemon that they hatch, up to a limit of 50% bonus in each stat.  As an example, Hatchery Helper Sam can thus have up to 60% Step Efficiency and 60% Attack Efficiency.  Maxing out a Hatchery Helpers stats takes 125,250 Pokemon Hatched by that helper.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
