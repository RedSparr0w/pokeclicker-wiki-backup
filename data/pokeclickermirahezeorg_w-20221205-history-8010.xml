== Uncategorized Tasks ==

== Categorized Tasks ==
These tasks are grouped with similar tasks for ease of navigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Page Creation''' is the creation of an entire page, and then adding all the information. It can also be adding images to the wiki, or otherwise large undertakings of fairly blank pages.
'''Finishing Touches''' is for pages that are missing a small bit of info, or need to have a few images uploaded to them.
'''Updating''' is for pages that were affected by the most recent update of the game, and thus have to be checked for informational inaccuracies.
'''Formatting''' is for pages that need to have the way that information is displayed on them changed. This can range from template changes, to changes in the general aesthetic of the page.

=== Page Creation ===
# Upload all town images
# Add all Underground Evolution Item Mine Layouts to their respective pages
# Add all new Alola stuff: [[Alola#Dungeons|Alola Dungeons]], (anything else as necessary)
# Check/Update/Add all flow-charts on [[Regions|Regional Pages]]

=== Finishing Touches ===

=== Updating ===
# Add Easter Event to [[Events]]
# Add explanation of Loot Weight to main [[Dungeons|Dungeon]] page
# Update [[Item Magnet]] effects
# Update all the [[Shops]] and [[Items]] ([https://github.com/pokeclicker/pokeclicker/pull/1730/files PR 1730])

=== Formatting ===

== Dream tasks ==
These tasks are so arduous (and such a low priority) that it is more of a dream to complete them.

# Make a "Wiki Code Hunt" for the game codes. Trivia questions should be added in a way to encourage wiki engagement. Once the hunt is made an NPC can be added to the game referencing it.
# add battle item type template for other pages in these headings, "Key items", "shop of each region" and any more that can be put under same big heading.
# add Shiny Variants to the normal Pokémon and a way to swap between the images.  This is something that's up to debate, as there's little use for it other than being something for us to do.
