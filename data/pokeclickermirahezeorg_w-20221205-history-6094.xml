    <text bytes="366" space="preserve">There are three different types of hatch-able resources in Pokéclicker: obtained Pokémon Eggs, Fossils, and already obtained level 100 Pokémon. Pokémon Eggs are typically purchased in Shops and Fossils are typically mined from the [[Underground]]. The Egg/Fossil/Obtained Pokémon that can be bred each have their own distinct tab in the Pokémon Day Care modal.</text>
