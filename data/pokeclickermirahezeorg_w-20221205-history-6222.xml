    <text bytes="347" space="preserve">'''Dungeons''' include forests, caves, buildings, and other places that are accessible by spending [[Dungeon Tokens]] in which wild Pokémon are encountered. Apart from the entrance fee, they differ from routes in that only 60 seconds are given to find and defeat a "Boss Pokémon" or "Boss Trainer", after which the dungeon is considered cleared.</text>
